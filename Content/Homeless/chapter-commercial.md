Many free and open source projects start out as hobbies - code hacked around on in a hacker's spare time, in their bedroom after school, in their basement, in the evening after work. The project brings people together around a common interest. The community grows as people work on the code. More and more users adopt the software. And then the hackers realise that this isn't just a hobby, it could be a business. 

The business model that supports an open source project can determine the success or failure of that project, and vice versa. Between the business and the project, there is a symbiotic relationship: the business generates income and provides contributors and support to the project. The project provides the software which in the bedrock for the business. The business needs to grow in a non-destructive, sustainable way, allowing the project to grow, mature, and continue to attract a diverse group of contributors. 

Running a business alongside a FOSS project in this way presents challenges that a traditional business doesn't need to consider: on the one hand, the business needs to consider investors and employees, on the other, the community of contributors that have no stake in the business but a huge stake in the project. Decisions come under scrutiny from both sides with differing perspectives. Walking the path between the two is a balancing act, and if the founder of the company also happens to be the founder of the project it can become a tightrope.		

In 2005, when Matt was thinking about setting up a business around WordPress, there hadn't yet been a large number of businesses run alongside open source projects. But there were a few, many of whom had their formative years in 2003-2005, about the same time the WordPress project was taking its first steps.		
Red Hat is the pioneer of open source business models. It was launched in 1995 through a merger of Bob Young's ACC Corporation which sold Linux and Unix software accessories, and Marc Ewing's Red Hat Linux distribution. Until 2003, the company distributed Red Hat Linux, and supported distribution and development by selling services and support. It became obvious, however, that this wouldn't scale and [the decision was made to stop distributing Red Hat Linux](http://arstechnica.com/business/2012/02/how-red-hat-killed-its-core-productand-became-a-billion-dollar-business/) and instead produce Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) with a focus specifically on enterprise customers. It also set up Fedora, a community-based operating system, whose liability still lies with Red Hat. Both Fedora and RHEL are open source and freely available, but the compiled version of RHEL is not. For enterprise customers to get access to a compiled version of RHEL they need to pay a subscription, for which they also get support. Fedora is often used as a testing ground for new RHEL features, many of which end up in the software. Four members of the nine-person Fedora Project Board are appointed by Red Hat. The ensures the sustainability of the Linux distribution, and helps with the Linux kernel - Red Hat is the [top contributor to the Linux kernel](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/09/google-and-samsung-soar-into-list-of-top-10-linux-contributors/).		

Another approach to supporting a free software project is the one taken by Mozilla. Mozilla was set up 1998 by Netscape (owned by AOL) to co-ordinate the development of the Mozilla Application Suite to power the Netscape browser. AOL's involvement was scaled back and, in 2003, the Mozilla Foundation was launched to ensure the continuation of the project. In 2005, the Mozilla Corporation was set up to handle the revenue-generating activities around Mozilla's products. It was generating, for example, large amounts of revenue from Google, which it included as a search provider in the browser. In 2006, [Google paid Mozilla $57 million to be the default search provider](http://techcrunch.com/2008/08/28/mozilla-extends-lucrative-deal-with-google-for-3-years/). Whereas the Mozilla Foundation focuses on project governance, the Corporation (which is a subsidiary of the Foundation) is a taxable organisation, free from the strict rules relating to non-profits, and which generates income to support the project.  In this model, the company and money-making side of the project is subject to the aims and intentions of the non-profit, with revenue generation supporting the project. 		
		
Another Linux-based open source business is Canonical, the company behind Ubuntu, a user-focused Linux distribution. Unlike Red Hat, which has its enterprise software and its community software, [Canonical focuses on one release](http://www.ubuntu.com/about/about-ubuntu): "The commercial and community teams collaborate to produce a single, high-quality release, which receives ongoing maintenance for a defined period. Both the release and ongoing updates are freely available to all users." Canonical is the project lead for Ubuntu and the major funder for the Ubuntu Foundation (set up in 2005), though production of the software is carried out by Canonical, other companies, and independent developers. Canonical monetises Ubuntu by selling services, training, and support around the core product. It also makes money by supporting companies like Dell that distribute Ubuntu on its laptops. Whether Canonical on its own is a sustainable business is yet to be proven. The company is [still supported by its billionaire founder Mark Shuttleworth](http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-08/13/mark-shuttleworth-canonical-ubuntu), and is constantly trying out new money-making techniques: in 2012 Ubuntu 12.10 [shipped search functionality that displayed results from Amazon](http://arstechnica.com/business/2012/09/ubuntu-bakes-amazon-search-results-into-os-to-raise-cash/), bringing the project under fire from both users and the [Free Software Foundation](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/ubuntu-spyware.html), and in 2013 it [ran an unsuccessful Indiegogo campaign](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/ubuntu-edge) to raise money for the development of Ubuntu Edge. 		

What all of these companies share is a belief in the power of free and open source software. They all produce software that is free (both as in freedom, and as in beer), and have found ways to generate income while keeping the core software. Making money is just one part of their aim: they want to popularise free and open source software for the benefit of society. And so perhaps it made sense for a business to spring up alongside WordPress, one that shared its commitment to the open web and the democratisation of publishing, a business that would help support and sustain the project. In 2005, when the open source business world was still nascent, Matt launched Automattic, but there were a few false starts and bumps before he got there. 		
		
Automattic wasn't the first, or even the second, idea for setting up a business around WordPress. While working at CNET, Matt pitched the idea of his employers for a product - a blog network that would hook in to your social networks. Many of the other big internet players had blog services - Google's Blogger, AOL's Journals, Yahoo 360, and MSN Spaces.  CNET didn't go for the idea, so Matt decided to pursue it himself.		

At the start of March 2005, there had been 50,000 downloads of WordPress 1.5, and just three weeks later the number had doubled to 100,000. To celebrate the landmark, Matt announced a [party in San Francisco](http://wordpress.org/news/2005/03/fifty-thousand/). On 22nd March, a group of WordPressers got together in the Odeon Bar in San Francisco. As with many parties in the tech industry, the booze was flowing.		

At the party was one of Matt's friends, Jonas Luster, [jluster](http://profiles.wordpress.org/jluster/). Jonas was an employee at [Collabnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CollabNet), the company behind Subversion. At the party they discussed, as they had discussed before, what a company built around a free software should look like. Matt's had an idea for an organisation called Automattic: an umbrella company that would include a number of different WordPress organisations. The first of these was WordPress Incorporated. At the party, Matt asked Jonas if he'd like to be involved. Jonas agreed.

Shortly afterwards Matt was on stage announcing the formation of WordPress Inc with Jonas Luster as employee number one. By the following morning, a [couple of blogs](http://sfist.com/2005/03/22/wordpress_incorporated.php) had [covered the announcement](http://laughingsquid.com/matt-mullenweg-announces-wordpress-inc/). A few days later, [Matt went on holiday](http://ma.tt/2005/03/wordpress-world-tour/) leaving WordPress' very first employee holding the reins.		
	
While the party was going on, there was a storm brewing. In February, a [user had posted on the WordPress.org support forums](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/odd-wordpress-articles?replies=6) asking about hundreds of articles hosted at wordpress.org/articles/. The articles were about everything from credit and healthcare to web hosting. The thread was closed by an unknown moderator. It was come across by blogger Andy Baio, however, who duly contacted Matt to ask him what was going on.		
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WordPress/book/master/Resources/images/commercial/wp_org_spam.png" width="800px" />

Matt provided Andy with an explanation. He was being paid by a company called Hot Nacho to host the articles on WordPress.org. He was using the money to cover the costs associated with WordPress. "The /articles thing isn't something I want to do long term," he told Andy, "but if it can help bootstrap something nice for the community, I'm willing to let it run for a little while." In addition to responding to Andy, Matt re-opened the support forum thread and [left a response](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/odd-wordpress-articles?replies=6#post-160502)		

> The content in /articles is essentially advertising by a third party that we host for a flat fee. I'm not sure if we're going to continue it much longer, but we're committed to this month at least, it was basically an experiment. However around the beginning of Feburary [sic] donations were going down as expenses were ramping up, so it seemed like a good way to cover everything. The adsense on those pages is not ours and I have no idea what they get on it, we just get a flat fee. The money is used just like donations but more specifically it's been going to the business/trademark expenses so it's not entirely out of my pocket anymore.		

On 30th March, while Matt was in Italy, Andy [published an article about it on his blog](http://waxy.org/2005/03/wordpress_websi/). The blogosphere exploded. No matter what Matt's intentions, people saw it as a shady SEO tactic. They felt that a free software project should know better than to get into bed with article spammers. Not only was WordPress.org hosting the spammy articles, CSS had been used [to cloak the articles](http://waxy.org/2005/03/wordpress_websi/#comment-18433). The fact that the articles were hidden only served to suggest that Matt knew that he was doing something wrong when he agreed to do it. If everything was above board, why not do it out in the open?		

With Matt out of town, it fell to Jonas to deal with the fallout from Andy's article. It wasn't clear where the [line between WordPress.org and WordPress Inc lay](http://waxy.org/2005/03/wordpress_websi/#comment-18519), but with Jonas was the only official-sounding person he was the one to receive the tech community's ire. While at a Technorati drink-up, someone came up to him and told him he needed to check his email. He returned to the technorati office to find his inbox full of emails asking what was going on.		

It was the first that Jonas had heard of the articles on WordPress.org. They'd been put there weeks before the WordPress Inc announcement. With Matt out of contact he spent the next few days putting out fires. He [posted on his blog asking for calm](https://web.archive.org/web/20050415082051/http://www.jluster.org/2005/03/spam-matt-wordpressorg-and-i-am-exhausted-bad-mix/), asking that Matt be given the benefit of the doubt. 		

[Some people saw it](http://www.forevergeek.com/2005/03/wordpress_making_money_the_wrong_way/) as the first move by WordPress Inc to make money, and took it as indicative that Matt and Jonas were't going to monetise WordPress in an ethical manner. Jonas did his best to emphasise that the articles had nothing to do with WordPress Inc, but since there was little clarity about what WordPress Inc actually was, it was easy for people to lump them together.		

By the next day, Andy had updated his post to report that WordPress' PageRank had dropped to 0/0, which meant that WordPress.org had been removed from Google's search engine results. 		

The WordPress and tech communities weren't the only people unhappy. Textdrive, who hosted WordPress for free on a  server along with apps such as Ruby on Rails, saw their server take a pounding from all of the hits from the links.		

The story escalated, with major tech resources picking it up ([The Register](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/03/31/cnet_weblog_keyword_scam/), [Slashdot](http://slashdot.org/story/05/03/31/196220/wordpress-banned-by-google-for-spamming), [Ars Technica](http://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2005/03/4759-2/). On March 31st, [Matt posted briefly on his blog](http://ma.tt/2005/03/back-online/) to say that he had just learned about what had happened and that he would get online to address the questions as soon as possible. The comments are littered with messages of support from [people who would later be central to the project](http://ma.tt/2005/03/back-online/#comment-18670) and even [from Matt's blog rival](http://ma.tt/2005/03/back-online/#comment-18673). He also received [support on WordPress' support forums](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/support-matt-mullweg?replies=23).		
	
On 1st April, [Matt issued a full response](http://ma.tt/2005/04/a-response/). In it, he stresses that he was struggling to find a way to support the open source project, that he felt that his options were limited:		

> To thrive as an independent project WordPress needs to be self-sufficient. There are several avenues this could go, all of which I've given a lot of thought to. One route that would be very easy to go in today's environment is to take VC funding for a few million and build a big company, fast. Another way would be to be absorbed by an already big company. I don't think either is the best route for the long-term health of the community. (None of these are hypothetical, they've all come up before.) There are a number of things the software could do to nag people for donations, but I'm very hesitant to do anything that degrades the user experience. Finally we could use the blessing and burden of the traffic to wordpress.org to create a sustainable stream of income that can fund WP activities.		

The decision to host the articles on WordPress.org was an attempt to mitigate some of the costs of the open source project. For many people, Matt's response sufficed to answer their concerns and questions. [But for others, it wasn't enough](https://web.archive.org/web/20050922005353/http://weblog.burningbird.net/archives/2005/04/01/there-is-communicationand-then-theres-not/). If a open source project had to resort to turning it's highly ranking website into a link farm, what was the future viability of that project? Weren't there other ways to support the project? Matt had been at the [web spam summit](https://ma.tt/2005/02/at-spam-summit/) in February, which had [specifically addressed](http://www.sifry.com/alerts/archives/000288.html) "comment spam, link spam, TrackBack spam, tag spam, and fake weblogs". Hadn't he, at that point, realised that there might be something dubious?		

As with most storms on the internet, when the articles were removed and Matt had issued his apology the outrage subsided. It did, however, have a lasting impact in a number of ways. It changed Matt's thinking about spam away from viewing it purely as something that is received in an email inbox, to web spam, which could quickly pollute the web. This fed into his thinking when developing Akismet, Automattic's anti-spam solution. And while Matt had learned a harsh lesson about ethical ways to make money on the web, it would return to haunt him again and again. Any time WordPress.org clamped down on search engine optimisation tactics, in themes for example, irate community member would bring up hot nacho.		

Jonas' first few weeks at WordPress Inc got off to an explosive start, and over the next few months he would continue to do unpaid work as WordPress Inc's only employee. He got in touch with major web hosts and created partnerships so that WordPress.org could make money by recommending hosting companies. He met with venture capitalists to talk about where WordPress was going.		

At an [IRC Meetup in August 2005](https://codex.wordpress.org/IRC_Meetups/2005/August/August03RawLog), Matt discussed some of the ways he wanted to see the project supported. Rather than go down the route of fundraising, he wanted to see a company that was responsible for generating revenue and that "the goal, eventually, is for it to be the biggest contributor someday, supporting community members to work on WP full-time." Donations to the project would be kept separate from the company. This would protect the project from any of the liabilities of the company and ensure that if the company was sold the project would be safe. In this chat, it's clear that the "inc" that Matt refers to in the chat isn't WordPress Inc, but the as-yet-unannounced Automattic. When asked about the employees, he says that the only one is Donncha, with Ryan Boren planned for the future. WordPress Inc itself fizzled out, disappearing with much less fanfare than it arrived. There wasn't money available in WordPress Inc to pay Jonas a salary, especially when Matt was using his own salary from his job at CNET to pay Donncha to work on WordPress.com.		

The wider community was [confused about what had happened with WordPress Inc](https://web.archive.org/web/20110816084138/http://www.airbagindustries.com/archives/008169.php), especially those who had watched Matt on stage announcing the launch of the company. In response, Matt [posted a page on the WordPress Codex](https://codex.wordpress.org/User:Matt/WordPress_Inc_Story), trying to explain what had happened:		

> At the WordPress 100k party in March 2005, I talked about the formation of a "WordPress Inc." with Jonas Luster as the first employee. That never really got off the ground, I continued my job at CNET and Jonas (who I couldn't afford to pay a salary) ended up going to work for Technorati. It wasn't even planned to be announced at the party (since it wasn't clear logistically how it would happen) but everyone was really excited about it and I had an extra G&T (or two), we all got carried away.		
	
In December that year, when the memory of WordPress Inc was fading, [Matt launched Automattic](http://ma.tt/2005/12/automattic-beta/), a new home for WordPress.com, Akismet, and the other products he had launched. It marked a beginning for its new employees, who now had to balance the aims of the open source project with the commercial concern of the company. . It's a balance that has affected both WordPress and Automattic throughout their close histories. 		

The intention for Automattic was to be a startup run along open source principles of distribution, openness, and collaboration. As the project grew so it would support Automattic, and Automattic could put resources back into the project.		

Automattic was launched with four employees - Donncha O'Caiomh, the original developer of WordPress MU, who was employed to start working on the infrastructure of WordPress.com earlier in June, Ryan Boren, Matt, and Andy Skelton. They all left their jobs and put their faith in WordPress being able to grow beyond an open source project to a platform that could sustain a blogging business. In the early days, there was very little money involved. Matt was paying Donncha and Andy from his CNET salary. 		
	
They were joined in January 2006 by Toni Schneider, who Matt had met in San Francisco through GigaOm founder Om Mailk. Toni was brought on board as CEO, or "adult supervision" as the startup world is fond of saying when an experienced CEO is brought in the shepherd young developers who have struck on a good idea. Toni's background was at OddPost, the webmail service that had been bought by Yahoo! Toni was a developer who became a CEO at a startup which was successfully acquired by one of the net's giants. OddPost became the basis of Yahoo! mail and Toni became a vice president at the company. After setting up the Yahoo! Developer Network, Toni left for new challenges at Automattic. 		
It was at OddPost that Toni had his first exposure to the power of open source projects. At a time when OddPost didn't have a spam filter, Paul Graham came out with his idea of [Bayesian spam filtering](http://www.paulgraham.com/spam.html). He open sourced the idea, and Toni's team implemented it at OddPost. "It just showed me that this is a really powerful model," he recalls.		

He was attracted to Automattic by the challenges of building a product around open source software. WordPress already had brand recognition but no one was making money from it yet. In a [2006 interview he said](http://money.cnn.com/2006/04/18/magazines/business2/startuptype/index.htm)		

> WordPress is an interesting new challenge because it's not like most startups, where the world still hasn't heard of you. WordPress is way past that stage. On the other hand, there is no business yet. Until Automattic came along, there was nobody working for it. It was all volunteers. So taking that product momentum and somehow turning that into a business will be really interesting.		

In Toni, Matt found someone with a development background, who had moved into the business side of the tech industry, who liked telling the story and bringing products to a larger audience.		

Other aspects of the project attracted Toni: this was a product that wasn't just a central, proprietary service, it wasn't owned solely by Matt or anyone else, but by all of the people involved, and it was open to anyone getting involved. Users could get involved in the process and have a stake in it, in a way that they couldn't with many of the other services around- Twitter and Facebook, for example. 		

And there was power in the fact that anyone could set up a WordPress blog. People are proud that they get it to work. Non-developers can set it up on a server and they feel empowered. It's different to just signing up to a service like Gmail or Facebook; WordPress is something that you can make your own.		

Automattic brought together the founders' experience in open source development and Toni's experience in business. There were certain things that worked in the project, that they wanted to maintain within the company, principles of open source development that underpin Automattic.		
	
The first of these was that the company should be distributed. Contributors in a FOSS project come from all over the world and collaborate together online, finding tools that suit their needs, and building their own when they're unavailable. The internet is perfect for this sort of development. Automattic sought to maintain this distributed nature, enabling it to hire people from all over the world, based on their skills, not on their location. Toni recalls how, in the early days of Automattic, people expected the distributed nature of the company to break down. It went against traditional businesses which kept employees supervised and in one place, with a focus on hours instead of output.		

In order to maintain this distributed nature, many of the early employees came from the project, and were already experienced at working in a distributed environment. Working online came natural to them. Those that found working in this way difficult didn't last at the company. Part of the recruitment process was ensuring that people were made aware of that it's like to work in a distributed environment. Eventually, Automattic developed a trial projects process, whereby potential employees would do a trial, working in the distributed environment to see if the company was the right fit.		
	
Automattic wanted to maintain a multiple release model, in which developers could push multiple small releases a day straight to the user. They eschewed the traditional [waterfall model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model), a development process which involved following a prescriptive sequence: drawing up specifications, design, construction, integration, testing and debugging, installation, and maintenance. At Automattic, developers could write patches and build features and push them straight to users.		
	
Automattic adopted a [continuous deployment](http://toni.org/2010/05/19/in-praise-of-continuous-deployment-the-wordpress-com-story/) model. By May 2010, Automattic had over 25,000 releases, averaging around 16 releases a day. Rather than optimising for perfection, the process is optimized for speed. Features are broken down into small components and code is incrementally launched. This means that developers and designers can quickly push their products to millions of users within a few second.		

It also helps to ensure that the people who build the product have a direct connection to the customer, doing away with as many levels of mediation as possible. This method of development keeps product people happy because they get to constantly push new ideas to customers, and customers happy because they're constantly getting new toys to play with and their feedback helps to refine the product.		

The other aim that they had for Automattic was to remain focused on the company, not on what was going on outside. This has meant building their core product and not getting distracted by the latest fad in Silicon Valley. 		
	
Following the initial setup of Automattic, the bulk of hiring was done from within the open source project. Seven of the first ten employees of Automattic were from the WordPress community, all of whom had an intimate knowledge of both developing and using the software. 		

Automattic had, at its fingertips, a wealth of developers who were not just experienced in the product, but who were passionate about it and who were committed to it, evidenced already by the fact that they had put considerable volunteer time into it.		
	
Automattic needed to be careful that the community didn't become disenfranchised from the product. It would have been easy, particularly when Toni was brought on board, for the perception to turn - a business man is brought into the project, people might think that Automattic was going to start charging for things.

They had, as a touchstone, the activities of their predecessor, Six Apart. Typepad, the hosted version of Movable Type, was provided by Six Apart for a 30 day trial, after that, if the user liked it they had to pay for it. The team at Automattic decided that this approach wouldn't work for them. Rather than go down the route of offering a free trial and then charging people at the end of it, they decided to adopt a freemium model.		
The freemium model is ubiquitous now, but on 2005/2006 it wasn't nearly as widespread. It has its roots in shareware, the software distribution model whereby the software is distributed for free, either for a limited time or with limited functionality. It puts the software in the hands of the users so they can play with it. The advantage for web services is that they can use word of mouth to spread the word about the product and each signup gives them direct access to the customer. While shareware was distributed on discs, freemium has become de rigour on the net. Different companies take different approaches, some offer a "lite" version of their service, restricting access to features. Others, like early pioneer Skype, offer a fully-functional version that is adequate for most users, with paid upgrades for people who want more. It was this approach that Automattic took. A blog would be free, as many as a user wanted, but once it went from being a hobby to something more serious, perhaps involving making money yourself, then you would have to pay. 		

While Toni was being recruited for Automattic, [the company received its first funding](https://ma.tt/2006/04/a-little-funding/). He wasn't officially CEO of Automattic at that time, but he had committed to the position. Having a solid CEO in place gave investors confidence that the business would be able to flourish. On top of that, WordPress already had a head start. WordPress.com had already had nearly 200,000 signups, and could demonstrate that it had potential. It was already built and people were using it, now was a good time for investors to get on board.		

That early round of funding took some of the heat off Matt and Toni in terms of staying on top of paying employee's salaries. Donncha, for example, reports that in the early days Matt or Toni had to go to the bank to pay his salary.
	
Before Automattic was even launched, Matt had already launched two products that would have a huge impact on the WordPress community - hosted blogging network WordPress.com, and spam-fighting plugin Akismet. In June 2005, Matt hired Donncha to work on building WordPress.com, paying him from his CNET salary. While they worked on the WordPress.com infrastructure, they had to spend months just acquiring the WordPress.com domain name.

A hosted service like WordPress.com needed to have a business behind it to pay for server costs, run the software, provide support, and build new features. The free software project, with its haphazard donations and income from hosting companies, couldn't maintain a such a network on a wide-scale.		

Creating a user-focused business made sense in the context of the WordPress project. WordPress had always been committed to users, sometimes to the detriment of developers. It has always had laypeople at its heart, people who don't necessarily know the mechanics of how a server worked but who a website.		

Automattic could have gone down the same track as Red Hat, providing enterprise versions of WordPress, but the team only had to look at their predecessors, Six Apart, to judge whether pursuing enterprise customers would keep their core values or not.		

WordPress.com was intended for people who wanted to just fill out a form and have a blog, but still have the power of WordPress. This meant that WordPress.com was a balancing act. There would always be people who wanted it simpler, with less functionality, and there would always be people who wanted it more like the WordPress software, with plugins. The team had to strike a middle ground, a place for people who didn't want to set up WordPress but who wanted to blog.		

Invites to [WordPress.com opened in August 2005](http://matt.wordpress.com/2005/08/15/invites/). Every person who signed up got one invite to pass along. Invites were much in demand, with one finding its way on to ebay.		

If people wanted to get their hands on WordPress.com but didn't want to wait for an invite, they could download the Flock browser. Flock was a social-media focused browser that had social networking built in to its interface. Both of these measures - invites and Flock - allowed WordPress.com to grow in a slow and sustainable way. Putting a barrier in the way of new sign-ups helped with scalability. At the time, scaling a platform quickly wasn't easy to do, and creating barrier to signups helped to control the flow of people.		

The same week, saw Matt taking a trip to the [Blog Business Summit](https://web.archive.org/web/20060116132637/http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/business/technology/12423079.htm) to show off WordPress.com. He had an 8am slot and he showed off WordPress.com to the business world. The feedback was positive, with bloggers writing that [WordPress.com was positioning itself up against Typepad](http://www.blogherald.com/2005/08/20/wordpress-commercial-arm-to-compete-against-typepad/).		On 21st November 2005, [WordPress.com was released to public signups](http://ma.tt/2005/11/wordpresscom-open/). 

The early days of WordPress.com were plagued by server issues. In late October, there was a [major hard drive failure](http://matt.wordpress.com/2005/10/31/back-to-the-future/)

Eventually Automattic needed to start making money. There were bills to pay and investors to keep happy. Automattic's only other income source was Akismet, which had an honour system - it was free for individuals but not for commercial users. [check: Akismet sales stats - what percentage of people actually paid for Akismet?] 

The first paid upgrade launched by WordPress.com was [CSS editing](http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2006/08/04/custom-css/#comment-4663), which gave WordPress users the flexibility of editing their theme with CSS. Shortly afterwards, domain mapping was launched. This was an obvious feature to charge for, because the domains had to be paid for. While other sites such as Blogger were proving domain mapping for free, Automattic decided that if you were serious enough about your website to require your own domain name, then you could pay for that. Later that year [they launched file storage](http://wordpress.com/blog/2006/12/06/running-out-of-space/).		

These upgrades made sense, particularly the ones that incurred additional costs for Automattic, as in the case of storage and domains. Some upgrades weren't particularly successful. Matt recalls now that the most unsuccessful upgrade was [unlimited private users](http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2006/10/27/unlimited-users-on-private-blogs/). This upgrade let users have more than 35 members on a private blog. Other features were more controversial. In 2006, Automattic [tested Google Adsense on WordPress.com](http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2006/07/27/testing-ads/), before rolling them out across WordPress.com blogs. It wasn't until 2009 that Automattic introduced a paid upgrade that [allowed WordPress.com user to remove the ads](http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2008/09/18/go-ad-free/). 		
	
Another way that Automattic sought to make money with WordPress.com was through providing enterprise-level support services to big websites that had more extensive support needs than the average WordPress user. Big, prominent sites such as CNET, About.com, and the New York Times were using WordPress, and other sites, such as GigaOm, Techcrunch, and Scobelizer, were shifting to WordPress.com.		

Automattic courted these big sites, initially as a marketing strategy. There was nothing that said "WordPress can scale" better than having big, high-traffic sites, hosted on it. If they were running WordPress successfully, then it was the best possible example that WordPress could run high-traffic, complex websites. Toni approached big websites to offer to host them on WordPress.com. The first included Scobelizer and the second Life Blog. Time was spent making sure that the companies were happy, making sure Akismet was set up, figuring out what plugins they needed, and providing support.		

What many of them needed was dedicated support from WordPress experts. At the start, Automattic saw their competitor as Typepad, who charge $49.95 for their enterprise version. Automattic tested different subscription levels. When they [launched the WordPress Support Network](http://toni.org/2006/06/26/automattic-support-network/) their subscription level was $5,000 per year. Also in 2006, they offered enterprise-level hosting - [when WordPress.com VIP hosting launched](http://ma.tt/2006/09/wordpresscom-vip/) it was priced at $250 per month.		

It soon became clear the because a piece of software was free, it didn't mean that the services around that software had to be cheap. Companies were prepared to pay enterprise prices to ensure that their website could scale and stayed online. Automattic, and other companies in the WordPress ecosystem, just had to develop confidence in building up their pricing structure.		
	
As Automattic tested out different ways of making money with WordPress, the company didn't only have its customers and investors to consider - it had the whole of the WordPress community to take into consideration. Automattic's actions could have a big impact on the project, especially since the founder of Automattic was the same person as the project lead of WordPress.		
	
From the very start, there was a lack of clarity about what was part of Automattic and what was part of WordPress.	 The two developers who led WordPress were both employees of Automattic, which appeared to make it an Automattic project. It was unclear even on the [original Automattic about page](https://web.archive.org/web/20051224051341/http://www.automattic.com/projects/) which lists WordPress as an Automattic project. 		

This was because, at its inception, Automattic was intended as an umbrella company for a number of different organisations, that would include Moebius Ltd and WordPress Inc.  It was also the case that, at that time, much of the work on WordPress was being done by employees at Automattic. It wasn't until much later that the confusion over who owned what would settle down.		
This confusion was compounded by the name of Automattic's blog network: "WordPress.com". While naming a company WordPress Inc might have taken things too far, the decision was made instead to call the main project WordPress, and have a shared name of WordPress.com and WordPress.org. "We gave the company this advantage of being able to call it's service WordPress.com," says Toni. "It's been a curse and a blessing." On the one had, people are always getting confused between the two, and many people don't even care that there is a difference. It confuses everyone from the press to WordPress users. The mainstream tech press, for example, frequently describes Automattic as the "[maker of WordPress](http://mashable.com/2014/04/09/automattic-acquires-longreads/)", which does a disservice to the hundreds of contributors who aren't at Automattic. The WordPress.org support forums are littered with questions about WordPress.com, and WordPress.com users are confused as to why they can't install plugins. On the other hand, Automattic has put millions of dollars into growing the WordPress brand and introducing the product to people who would instead of gone to Blogger or Tumblr or some alternative blogging service rather than going down the self-hosted route. It's unlikely that the open source project would have had the money or the drive to do such extensive branding. There are many people whose first exposure to WordPress is via WordPress.com, and some of those shift to the open source project. A survey carried out by WordPress hosting company WP Engine, found that 30% of respondents had heard of WordPress. 		
	
The WordPress.org support forums was one of the places where the confusion over WordPress's name caused even bigger problems, When WordPress.com was initially set up, there were no support forums. This meant that WordPress.com users [found their way to the WordPress support forums to get help](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/bug-images-not-showing-in-categories). WordPress.com was a hosted service, so neither WordPress.com users or support forum volunteers had access to the server or code to carry out debugging. There was little that the volunteers could do to help them. [Discussions](http://codex.wordpress.org/IRC_Meetups/2005/September/September21RawLog) were had about this issue at a [number of IRC Meetups](http://codex.wordpress.org/IRC_Meetups/2005/September/September28RawLog).		

This influx of WordPress.com users added to the workload of the volunteers, which was fine so long as WordPress.com was a free service. But "I don't mind supporting people who are all for the free stuff", said [masquerade](http://profiles.wordpress.org/masquerade), at a September 2005 Meetup, "but as soon as wp.com goes paid, I'm not helping them. I won't be matt's slave with no pay." Eventually, WordPress.com started providing support itself, first of all via an email address, then on a community support forum where customers could help each other, and later using a ticketing system. Matt hired Mark Riley, Podz, at Automattic, and for a long time he was solely responsible for support at WordPress.com. The next person hired for support was in 2008. In that time 49,486 support tickets were closed Nowadays, WordPress.com users have a community on their own forums and a huge team of "Happiness Engineers" provides support across Automattic, but still, it's not uncommon that one of them lands on the WordPress.org forums looking for help.		

In late 2005, as well as launching WordPress.com, [Matt launched the Akismet plugin for WordPress](http://ma.tt/2005/10/akismet-stops-spam/). Akismet (which stands for Automattic kismet) is a way of dealing with spam in aggregate, a crowd-sourced spam-fighting tool. 		

Each time a comment is posted to your website, it's submitted to Akismet and checked against all of the other comments in the database. If it's spam, it's deleted, if it's not it lands on your site. If a piece of spam gets through and a user then marks it as spam, this comment is added to the database. So the pool of spam comments is constantly widening, making Akismet into something that is more effective over time.		
	
Web spam is a big problem for bloggers. Spammers leave comments on blogs and sometimes bloggers can receive hundreds or thousands of spam comments in a short period of time. Some spam comments are designed to fool the blogger, they are written with generic flattery that an unsuspecting blogger can take for a genuine comment. The aim of these spammers is to get your blog visitors to click the link back to their site. Spamming is sometimes automated, sometimes it's done by people, and spammers are always looking for ways to get around anti-spam.		
	
Spam has always been a problem; its the old problem of unsolicited mail in your mailbox, but on a huge scale. Email spam has always been a problem but blogging created gaps all over the internet where opportunities for user-inputted data were taken advantage of by spammers. It's not just comment boxes that leave bloggers vulnerable. Technology such as trackback is susceptible to spam; Movable Type was afflicted particularly badly for a long time by trackback spam.		

Akismet ran on an honour system - it was free for individuals or non-commercial bloggers, but once you started making money you were asked to pay.		

In November 2005, Matt started a discussion on the wp-hackers mailing list [asking list members for suggestions of plugins that could be bundled with core](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2005-November/003162.html). The developers were keen to have an anti-spam solution available for WordPress users. Akismet was discussed, but [not everyone was comfortable bundling a plugin that had a commercial element to it](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2005-November/003177.html), and there were concerns about [the data that Akismet collected and how it was stored](https://codex.wordpress.org/IRC_Meetups/2005/October/October26RawLog). Besides, to use Akismet, a person needed a WordPress.com account and WordPress.com was still an invite-open service. Not everyone had an invite. For those that didn't, they could download the Flock browser but not everyone wanted to download a new browser.		

But not [everyone was against it](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2005-November/003189.html), and [Matt checked Akismet into core in mid-November](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3161#file0). When WordPress 2.0 beta came out in November 2005, it came bundled with Akismet. And WordPress users had a new weapon against spam. Two days later, [WordPress.com was open to public signups](http://ma.tt/2005/11/wordpresscom-open/). 		

The concern continued that a plugin that made money was shipped with WordPress. People felt that this gave Automattic an unfair advantage.	Discussions about whether Akismet should continue to ship with core are returned to perennially in the community, including amongst the core developers and at core team meet ups.  "It seems an unfair advantage and it cuts against WordPress' goal of openness," says Mark Jaquith, "That being said, spam is still a huge problem and Akismet is still the leading product, even though there are now alternatives." 

The open nature of the WordPress plugins makes it difficult to develop a widely-adopted anti-spam plugin. As soon as a plugin has wide-spread adoption, spammers will learn how it works and get around it. So while the team has discussed adopting a model in which a number of different anti-spam options are recommended, it isn't yet viable. "The moment we recommend five plugins," says Andrew Nacin, "the spammers will all target the other four that don’t have the ability to evolve and learn like Akismet does." It's creates a challenging intersection between business and free software. Including a freemium plugin with the software doesn't gel completely with the software's openness goals, but, at the same time, taking it away could have a detrimental effect on users, which goes against the project's user-first principles. Akismet continues to be bundled with core, and the issue continues to be discussed.

In 2011, however, Automattic made some changes to the signup process that made members of the WordPress community angry. In the past, users could just select the free version and sign up for that. Automattic introduced a "pay what you want version" with a slider with which the user could select how much they wanted to pay. $24/year and over and the slider had a smiley face, but below that it turned to a progressively deeper frown, with the deepest frown reserved for $0.		

[Automattic reported](http://blog.akismet.com/2011/08/15/smile/) that people who paid for Akismet were prepared to pay more, with a big leap between $12 and $24 (the point at which the Akismet smiley started to smile). For some, this was the first time that they had noticed that Akismet was a commercial service. A ticket was opened up on WordPress trac, asking [that Akismet be removed from core](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/16838). In the discuss, Andrew Nacin, one of WordPress' lead developers said that while he would like to unbundle Akismet from core, there were practical considerations, the foremost of which was that users didn't want spam on their blog.		
	
Akismet and WordPress.com weren't the only things that caused tension in the community. People were suspicious that Automattic would take over WordPress. Would they mess it up? Would it remain a real open source project? Much of the ire of the community was directed towards Matt. As the project lead and the co-founder of Automattic, he straddled both organisations in a very public way. For the community it wasn't always clear when he was representing Automattic and when he was representing the project. When he made a decision that people were unhappy with, people felt that he was acting in his capacity as founder of Automattic, its commercial interests, and all that entailed. Even as the project became comfortable with Matt's dual-role, there were always questions about his ability to lead both. A blog post from 2009 [questioned Matt's ability to lead the project](https://web.archive.org/web/20091119030354/http://brandingdavid.com/blogging/my-thoughts-on-the-current-state-of-the-wordpress-project). In the comments, both Matt and Mark Jaquith weigh in on the comments. Matt emphasised that much of the day to day running of the project had been passed over to the other lead developers, while Mark vouched for the project lead; "He is effectively the face of WordPress — an ambassador, if you will. He's smart, charismatic and a seasoned world-traveler — perfect qualities for a "lead advocate" or "project visionary" type of role."		
	
Matt wasn't the only Automattic employee who community members were concerned about. As WordPress.com grew, it [looked like WordPress.org was being left to founder](http://wank.wordpress.com/2007/05/01/how-to-lose-your-soul-slightly/). Both Ryan and Matt, who were the only committers and the main developers of WordPress had this other thing that they had to look after. Both WordPress.com and WordPress 2.0 launched in December 2005, and the next major update of WordPress didn't appear until January 2007. For WordPress, that was a long delay between releases. 

Whatever the perception, it wasn't WordPress.com that caused the delays. At that time, there was very little to distinguish between WordPress.com and WordPress. Most of the WordPress.com developers were working on WordPress the product. The delay came because of the constant desire to add just one more new feature to WordPress.		

Everything that Matt did was scrutinised. In November 2009 he took part in Microsoft's Professional Developer Conference in Los Angeles. A site was launched, and the tech press was [quick to accuse Matt of being a hypocrite](http://www.inquisitr.com/48394/mullenweg-fails-again/). Somehow the news became that WordPress.com was moving to Microsoft Azure. Microsoft have long been the enemy of open source projects and Matt had never been quiet about criticising the company. The announcement was, in fact, that WordPress could run on an open source stack of Apache, PHP, and MySQL on a Windows Azure setver.		

On Automattic's part, they've had to figure out how they could best support the project in a way that was sustainable for the project and for the company. Most of the early employees had come from the WordPress project, they had given their time freely to a project that they wanted to succeed, on its own merits, not on the merits of commercial entity that had sprung up alongside it. One idea that was discussed was to have just one WordPress support for .com and .org, with Automattic providing all of the support for WordPress. They decided, however, that having a company run support for an open source project wouldn't be good for the project, and could add to the confusion.		

Automattic open sources a lot of its code to the community, in the form of plugins, themes, and other tools. There is constant pressure from inside the company for Automattic to open source more of its code. Many of the developers in the company come from an open source background and it makes sense to them for code to be distributed and available to the rest of the community. 		

Some of the support provided by Automattic went on behind closed doors. Toni, for example, worked a lot with businesses to figure out how they would build their own businesses in a way that was sustainable and non-destructive. When there were concerns about the premium theme market, Toni spent time working with theme developers to help them to understand the GPL.		

[quote from Phil Black interview]		

Features, when they are suited to all WordPress users, are usually developed by the WordPress core team, and Automattic internally develops ones suited to WordPress.com users. This hasn't always been the case. Early on, Andy Skelton developed a [widget user interface](http://andy.wordpress.com/2006/03/08/widgets-user-interface-and-api/) for WordPress.com. This was hugely popular with WordPress.com users - it made their WordPress themes even more flexible. The [community consensus](https://codex.wordpress.org/IRC_Meetups/2006/June/June07RawLog) was that widgets would make an excellent addition to core, and they were [brought in in WordPress 2.2](http://wordpress.org/news/2007/05/wordpress-22/).		

Automattic and WordPress.com provided a way for people who were passionate about WordPress to earn their living while working on it. Seven out of the ten first Automattic employees came from the WordPress community, and over the years the company has hired more and more talented contributors. While this has been positive for individuals and for Automattic, it hasn't always had a positive effect. In the early days, when WordPress.com was almost the sole focus, contributors would work on the core project which would then benefit Automattic. But some early contributors who became employees of Automattic found that they could spend less and less time on the project. Mark Riley, for example, was was employed to do support, found that he had no time to help out on the WordPress.org support forums. For other people, this has happened slowly, over time, as Automattic expanded out into other products, going in one direction, while the core project evolved into a different place, one with governance and structures, wildly different to the days of throwing up patches, heated discussions on wp-hackers, and waiting for Matt or Ryan to commit your code.		

As Automattic has grown, it has formed its own community. Automatticians often describe this as the Automattic family. They meet up all over the world, form close bonds, and intense working relationships. Contributors from the project who move to Automattic find that they become absorbed in the company culture and their contributions to the open source project diminish.		

To combat this, Automattic has one of its most abiding ways to support the project - the dot org team. This is a team of people within the company who are dedicated to working on the open source project. Ongoing members of the team are Ryan Boren and Andrew Ozz, WordPress lead developers, Jen Mylo, formerly UX lead of WordPress and responsible for the Crazyhorse redesign, and Andrea Middleton, who manages WordCamps. Teams are fairly fluid inside Automattic, and people come in to the dot org team to work on the WordPress project, often bringing with them the knowledge and skills that they've developed elsewhere in the company. Employees can also do a "dot org rotation", which means that they work on the WordPress project for a release cycle.		

As a way of enabling other people to contribute to the project full-time, completely outside of the commercial aspects of Automattic, Matt set up Audrey Capital. Audrey Capital is a small research and investment company through which Matt does his investments and employs people to work on the WorDPress project. It started life in XXXXX. It's first employee was Samuel Wood ([Otto](http://profiles.wordpress.org/otto)). 

Audrey Capital started through Otto and Matt's shared love of Barbecue. Otto was looking for a sponsor for a BBQ team at the international barbecue festival in Memphis. Knowing Matt likes barbecue, Otto called him up to ask him to sponsor the team. Matt said yes, and came to Memphis for the festival. The following year he sponsored again. This time, after the festival, he asked Otto if he wanted to come work for him. Otto said yes. 

To begin with, Otto was just paid directly by Matt to work on WordPress.org. The following year [check dates], he hired Andrew Nacin and officially set up Audrey Capital. Since then, three more people have been employed by Audrey to work on the WordPress project.

Matt had a number of intentions for Audrey Capital: the first was to have a company to help out new entrepreneurs. Secondly, he had lest time to code and wanted to hire some coders to do what he couldn't. And third, to provide a balance of people working on WordPress - some from Automattic, some from Audrey, and some from other companies. Since being launched, Audrey Capital has employed five people to work on the WordPress project.

The relationship between Automattic and the wider WordPress community hasn't always been an easy or straightforward one. Much of the tension between Automattic lay around the WordPress trademark. Getting the trademark and registering the domains was part of Toni's early work at the company. He had to figure out how to ensure WordPress was an open enough brand for everyone to participate in without it becoming a confusing mess. Matt hadn't yet secured the trademark, and it wasn't until [March 2006 that Automattic filed to register the WordPress trademark](http://www.trademarks411.com/marks/78826734), with the registration completing in January 2007. Just prior to filing registration, a domain policy was added to WordPress.org, requesting that [community members not use WordPress in their domains](https://web.archive.org/web/20060221154915/http://wordpress.org/about/domains/). 		

Once the application to register the trademark was submitted, Automattic had to go about protecting the trademark. This meant getting people who used WordPress in their domain name or product name to change it. It wasn't entirely straightforward. WordPress had been a community project for two years and many people felt that they had a stake in it. There were plenty of websites that used WordPress in their domain names. And it wasn't wholly clear what people could and could do. In the comment thread of [Lorelle van Fossen's blog](http://lorelle.wordpress.com/2006/10/26/using-wordpress-in-your-domain-name-dont/), community members are curious as to whether they can use label "on WordPress" (as in "Lorelle on WordPress") on their blogs. 		

One domain change that [caught some attention in the community](http://wank.wordpress.com/2006/03/17/wanky-wank-wank-wank/) was a site called wordpress-arena.com which was [running a WordPress theme contest](https://web.archive.org/web/20060422014104/http://www.arenawp.com/?p=10). In the comments, Matt left a message of support, along with a note that said "Unfortunately for every cool usage (like this competition, potentially) there are a dozen scammers and spammers misusing WordPress, selling spamming scripts or copies of WP itself."		

Six months later, cease and desist letters were sent out people who persisted in using WordPress in their domain, and Matt found himself up against some of the net's most popular internet marketers. The incident was centered around two websites that had been running for some time with WordPress in their domain name: [wordpressvideos.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20060402224841/http://wordpressvideos.com/), run by Brandon Hong, and [wordpresstutorials.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20060705071350/http://www.wordpresstutorials.com/), run by Sherman Hu. A blogger called [Andy Beard alerted the community](http://andybeard.eu/112/wordpress-trademark-scammers.html) to the fact that the two websites had been asked to stop using the name WordPress in their domain. In his post, he remarks on Automattic's tardiness in actually registering the domain and preventing others from using it. He also takes issue about the two sites being singled out: one of them had been online for a year and both provided WordPress services and had cultivated their own communities, they weren't, he felt, the "spammy products" that Matt thought they were. Besides, just a year early, Matt had hosted a link farm on WordPress.org.		

Matt took to the comments and [left a comment that had the internet marketing community up in arms](http://andybeard.eu/112/wordpress-trademark-scammers.html#comment-44):		
> I find most affiliate marketing quite distasteful, and we have not even though of hiring anyone in those or SEO fields, or offering training for any of the above.		
					
> When we do documentation or videos, it's free to everybody.		
					
> If Sherman Hu or Brandon Hong had spent their time contributing to the Codex or support forums instead of trying to sell WP snake oil and taking advantage of a lack of good documentation in Open Source community software, I bet they would have made a lot more honest money by now.		

People [jumped to the defence of the two websites](http://andybeard.eu/112/wordpress-trademark-scammers.html#comment-63). Even those who were supportive of Automattic's position with regards to the trademark, were angered by Matt's positioning of the two sites as "snake oil" salesmen. Customers and friends of Sherman Hu flocked to the blog post to voice their support for Sherman. Outside of that blog, prominent internet marketers wrote about it on their blogs. They took issue with Matt branding long-copy sales letters as spammy and scammy. [Brian Clark, at copyblogger, pointed out that while a website's design](http://www.copyblogger.com/does-your-copy-look-spammy/) might not appeal to some people, it will appeal to others. That Sherman's and Brandon's website and branding didn't appeal to Matt didn't mean that it wasn't appealing to other people.		

Eventually the [sites came to an agreement with Automattic](http://andybeard.eu/134/wordpress-tutorials-business-as-usual.html), and [WordPress Videos came out with a redesign](https://web.archive.org/web/20061130162903/http://www.wordpresstutorials.com/?).		

It took another four years for the WordPress trademarks to be passed to the WordPress Foundation. During that time, Automattic would be dogged with trademark violations that they would constantly have to address.		

Internally to Automattic there was constant discussion about which activities belonged as part of Automattic and which part the Foundation or the project. 		

Toni Schneider says that the thinking was that "Automattic might get acquired some day. Let's say Microsoft buys it. Or Amazon. One of these big companies. Would we want, whatever we're deciding on, would we want Microsoft to own that someday?"		

One example was WordCamps. The first WordCamp was in San Francisco but soon they started popping up all over the world. Most big companies have their own expos and conferences, and these are usually money-making ventures - if Automattic was sold, would it be good for the community if Microsoft had ownership of WordCamps? 

And then there was the trademark. They couldn't countenance a big company acquiring the trademark for the open source project.  They couldn't just give it to Matt, because having the trademark owned by just one person wasn't the right solution. Instead the decision was made to put the trademark in a Foundation that could own it and make sure that it remained protected. "The WordPress trademark had started out under the ownership of Automattic, with always being the intention that it would be transferred to the WordPress Foundation," says early investor Phil Black.	As part of that donation, Automattic was given rights to use the trademark, but just for WordPress.com, not for anything else. They can't start up any new ventures with the name "WordPress" in them. 		

In January 2010, the website for the WordPress Foundation was launched, and [later that year the trademarks were transferred to the Foundation](http://ma.tt/tag/wordpress-foundation/).		

Two years in and WordPress.com had its first serious acquisition offer. A group of people wanted to buy WordPress.com. They had no interest in buying Akismet and the other products. A deal was negotiated, reported in the tech press to be a $200 million acquisition offer. Serious thought was put into the offer. Automattic's investors felt that the company should keep going but it was still tempting. Matt recalls how the acquisition would have resulted in nine figures for him personally. There were also personnel issues going on inside Automattic that meant that running the business was harder than Matt had originally thought it would be. Running Automattic wasn't always fun.		

But, just because it was difficult at times, it didn't mean that there was anything else that Matt wanted to do. He recalls now:		
> I realised if I had 150 million dollars I would want to do exactly what I was doing then, I wouldn't want to change a thing. You know I did then and still to this day like really really love what I do. In fact the number has gone up, I would pay a billion dollars to do exactly what I do today. I was travelling to WordCamps, I was speaking and connecting with WordPress folks, I was coding, shipping the software, working on WordPress.com, working with guys who I loved working with, and I was like, well I can't imagine this getting any better.		
A rumour went around that Automattic was going to be sold and Toni was approached by an interested party who wanted to invest. The interest sparked a second round of funding, from both new investors and Automattic's original investors, in which they raised $30 million.		

While some Automattic employees were focused on building the core WordPress software, over the years others have had WordPress.org as a focus. Teams have built all sorts of features for WordPress.com users, including stats, publicise tools, image resizing, galleries, and a contact form. While many of these features were available as plugins on WordPress.org, it was Matt's vision to unify them, providing a single package that would bring all of WordPress.com's features to self-hosted WordPress users; this idea roamed the virtual hallways for a long time, simply as an idea known as "dot org connect".		

Automattic has a flat structure, with individuals working in small teams on different projects. Team Social took on the task of developing Jetpack. The process is described by Scott Berkun, in his book about working at Automattic, _The Year without Pants: WordPress.com and the Future of Work_.

[Jetpack launched in March 2011](http://jetpack.me/2011/03/09/blast-off/). As well as launching the product to the WordPress community, Automattic had created partnerships with hosting companies Bluehost, Dreamhost, Go Daddy, Media Temple, Host Gator, and Network Solutions. This meant that people who used the one-click installer on these hosts also got Jetpack installed. 		

While lots of users loved the functionality, it wasn't a big hit across the whole community. People questioned why they had to connect to WordPress.com to use functionality that they had previously been able to use standalone. While services such as stats required a connection to WordPress.com, functionality such as Twitter Widgets didn't. Other functionality, like After the Deadline, hadn't required a connection while it was a standalone plugin, but now it did. Jetpack had to be connected to WordPress.com to get access to any of the modules. Other concerns that people had were the intrusiveness of the plugin - it adds a big blue nag message to ask people to connect to WordPress.com, places itself at the top of the WordPress admin menu, and the module activation screen doesn't fit in with the overall user interface. People also took issue with the fact that some modules were activated by default - when the plugin is activated some modules are on and some aren't.		

This was a conscious decision made by the team.  "The idea behind that is, if you make it opt-in instead of opt-out, nobody uses any of it," says Toni Schneider. "They just turn on stats or whatever they want, and they never even look at the rest. So it's kind of wasted. Whereas most of it is actually quite useful."		

Other than the tools it publishes and code it shares on Github, Jetpack is the main connection that Automattic has with self-hosted WordPress users. 		

In January 2014, just after leading the 3.8 release cycle, [Matt took over as CEO of Automattic](http://ma.tt/2014/01/toni-automattic-ceo/). A few months later, in May, he [announced that Automattic had raised $160 million in funding](http://ma.tt/2014/05/new-funding-for-automattic/), with the [company being valued at $1.16 billion](http://time.com/88025/wordpress-parent-automattic-joins-the-billion-dollar-club/). In his post on the funding, Matt writes about how the additional funding will allow them to hire more staff, work on new products, and scale up the company. He makes a nod to the hundreds of developers and the large commercial companies who make up the WordPress ecosystem.  

The road towards building a billion-dollar business around a free and open source project hasn't always been easy. Automattic has come under continued scrutiny from the project. But the community has grown to trust Automattic as being one of the biggest contributors and supporters of the WordPress project. WordPress.com continues to have positive impact as a major testing ground for WordPress. Before WordPress is released, it is merged with WordPress.com and its features pushed to WordPress.com users. The feedback that comes from WordPress.com is invaluable to developing the software. Nowhere else is WordPress beta tested on so many people at once. WordPress.com also pushes WordPress to the limits in terms of scaling, a living demonstration that the software has the capacity to scale to support millions of users. 

It is also a place from which new features can emerge. Like with widgets in 2006, WordPress.com was the development ground for the theme customiser, which was brought over and merged into the core software, and which is evolving to become one of WordPress' most significant tools.
