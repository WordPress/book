In early 2000, a new wave of user-generated content was sweeping the internet. The dot-com bubble had burst and many internet companies were in disarray. But while companies failed, individuals sought new ways to get their voices online. Blogging communities sprang up all over the internet. Tight-knit connections were created between people who never met in real life but knew each other's thoughts through what they wrote online. Real names didn't matter - people created an online identity and went by a self-styled moniker.

The co-founders and early developers of WordPress started out as bloggers. They came to WordPress via blogging, not the other way round. Like every blogger, each of them had their own reason for going online to get heard; to create a home on the internet, to have a sense of authorship, to share ideas and reach an audience, to get involved with topical debates, to post about what they read, what they ate, the movies they watched, and the things they did with their friends. To post about school or work or family, to post cat photographs.

Reading old posts, the topic that comes up again and again is the choice of blogging platform: the names Blogger, Movable Type, LiveJournal, Greymatter, and b2 are thrown around. Some bloggers talk about building their own platform, others look for ways to improve the platform they've got. But where did that impetus come from? Not just to write, but to improve the tools one writes with, to get content online ever easier, ever faster, to share those tools with the world.

A well-worn phrase in the open source world is "scratching your own itch." This means creating the tools that you need to use, whether that's a blogging platform, a text editor, or an operating system. By being both the developer of the software and its user, the developer knows whether the tools they create meet their real needs. The developers are the users. When they write code, they use it just as any user would. They know what works and what doesn't. Scratching an itch gives the developer a closer relationship with the software's users, it’s grass-roots development, bottom-up as opposed to top-down. It's been a feature throughout open source software development, and at the start of the century lots of bloggers were feeling itchy.

In February 2002  Matt Mullenweg (matt) was home from school in Houston, Texas. He sat at his homemade PC, surrounded by posters of his favorite Jazz musicians. With nothing better to do, he got a copy of the Movable Type blogging platform, installed it on a web server and [published his first blog post] (http://ma.tt/2002/02/testing-new-system/).

"I suppose it was just a matter of time before my egotist tendencies combined with my inherit geekiness to create some sort of blog. I’ve had an unhealthy amount of fun setting this up. This will be a nexus where I talk about and comment on things that interest me, like music, technology, politics, etc. etc."

The title of his blog post, _testing new system_, was like thousands of other first blog posts before him. A post to test out the new platform and to tell the world, "here I am."

A few months later and nearly five thousand miles away, Mike Little (mikelittle) sat in the cellar that was his home office. The cellar of the house had been transformed; tanked, carpeted, and lined with his books and hundreds of CDs. Taking up most of his desk was a 17inch CRT monitor. He had spent his Sunday installing an open source blogging platform, b2. [His first post] (http://zed1.com/journalized/archives/2002/04/21/welcome/), not unlike Matt's, stated his blogging platform and his intent. "There will either be nothing here," he wrote, "or a collection of random thoughts and links. Nothing too exciting. But then again I'm not an exciting person."

These two inauspicious blog posts mark the beginning of not only two blogs, but a blogging platform; not just a blogging platform, but the most widely-used blogging platform and content management system in use today. In different parts of the world, with completely different platforms, two people caught the blogging bug and caught it bad. Not only did they want to publish their content online but soon after setting up their blogs they sought ways to scratch their own itch. They wanted to get their content online faster and more efficiently, create better tools for their websites and for sharing content, to refine the tools that they used, and to share those refinements with the rest of the world.

Blogging, while not quite in its infancy, was still maturing. In 1998, a few years before Matt and Mike entered the blogosphere, there were just a handful of what could be called weblogs. Often, these were curated collections of links with snarky or sarcastic commentary. They provided a filtering function, pre-surfing the web for readers who could browse through links on weblogs that they trusted. One of the earliest bloggers, [Justin Hall] (http://www.links.net/), [collected links] (http://www.links.net/www/index.html) to the darkest corners of the internet. In addition to sharing the weirdest things he found on the internet, Hall was one of the first people to pour his personal life into his online diary, sharing everything of himself with the net, which culminated in a [breakdown video] (http://www.links.net/daze/05/01/14/dark_night_flick.html).

Rebecca Blood noted this transition from linklog to personal diary  in 2000, when she wrote [an early history of blogging] (http://www.rebeccablood.net/essays/weblog_history.html). In her article, she talks about traditional weblogs as a curated collection of links, as opposed to blogging as the new form. Blogs transformed from “a list of links with commentary and personal asides to a website that is updated frequently, with new material posted at the top of the page.” This is the type of blog that we're familiar with today. Blogging software publishes content with the most recent at the top of the page. When a visitor lands, they get to see the latest post. This original premise of self-publishing on the web has continued throughout the history of blogging from the earliest online diaries to weblogs to tumblogs and even to microblogging such as Twitter. We've become accustomed to the most recent content first, have been conditioned to identify the publication of personal thoughts when we see it.

Many of the first bloggers were those already involved with the web, software developers like Dave Winer, designers like Jeffrey Zeldman, and technologists like Anil Dash. This meant that much of the earliest blog content was about the web and technology, interspersed with more diffuse thoughts and commentary about the blogger's life. Bloggers often had a tendency toward meta-commentary and would write about the tools [used to write their blogs] (http://scripting.com/1997/11/24.html) and the [improvements that they made to their sites] (http://dashes.com/anil/1999/08/pulldown-menus.html). While blogging had a steady growth during this period, the community was still considered geeky and insular. [Journalists spoke disparagingly of bloggers](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/05/books/the-close-reader-at-large-in-the-blogosphere.html) and rarely took their reporting seriously.

In 2001, blogging started to permeate the public consciousness. American political blogs became popular in the wake of the September 11th attacks on the World Trade Centre and the Pentagon. Blogs such as [Instapundit] (http://pjmedia.com/instapundit/) and [The Daily Dish] (http://dish.andrewsullivan.com/) saw a massive surge in popularity. Andrew Sullivan, the blogger behind The Daily Dish, [said that] (http://sullivanarchives.theatlantic.com/culture.php)  people didn't come to his blog just for news; "They were hungry for communication, for checking their gut against someone they had come to know, for emotional support and psychological bonding."

This was one of the first indications of the power of blogging - it gave people a voice online, provided a platform where people could come together to grieve.  In his book _Say Everything: How Blogging Began, What It’s Becoming, and Why it Matters_, Scott Rosenburg talks of how, despite the burst of the dot-com bubble, the final quarter of 2001 saw an increase in blogging. “Something strange and novel had landed on the doorstep,” Rosenburg writes in his introduction, “the latest monster baby from the Net. Newspapers and radio and cable news began to take note and tell people about it. That in turn sent more visitors to the bloggers’ sites, and inspired a whole new wave of bloggers to begin posting.” Since that time blogging, and later social media, has played a pivotal role in politics, public life, and even revolutions.

The evolution of blogging was mirrored in the tools that enabled bloggers to get their content online. Services like Geocities and Tripod enabled anyone to create a website, but these sites had little in common with the dynamic stream of content on a blog. People created the earliest blogs manually, using HTML and FTP. Justin Hall, on his weblog, had a page titled [Publish Yo' Self] (http://www.links.net/webpub/) which claimed that "HTML is easy as hell!" and taught people how to write HTML and publish it online. However, this was still a barrier to entry and programmers sought a way to make it easier. The dream was to create a tool that would let people write content and publish it to the web with one click. Dave Winer, whose popular [Scripting News] (http://scripting.com/) was one of the earliest blogs, set up UserLand Software which developed [Frontier NewsPage] (http://scripting.com/frontier/netScripting/newsPage.html), a tool that enabled people to create news-oriented websites like Scripting News.

However, not everyone wanted to recreate Scripting News and besides, if you weren't already familiar with the internet, setting up your own hosting and running the tool would still have been a complex task. In 1998, [Open Diary,] (http://www.opendiary.com/) an online community where people could write their diary online and communicate with other diarists, launched. Then came [LiveJournal] (http://www.livejournal.com/) and [Pitas.com] (http://www.pitas.com/) in 1999. In the same year, [Pyra Labs launched] (http://evhead.com/1999/08/we-just-launched-cool-new-tool-at-pyra.asp) [Blogger] (http://blogger.com). Blogger automated publishing a blog to a web server: the user would write their content, and Blogger uploaded the page to the server after each post. Blogger is often credited with popularizing blogging. The following year, Dave Winer released [Radio UserLand] (http://radio.userland.com/).

Movable Type, the platform which would be one of WordPress' biggest competitors, launched in 2001. Ben and Mena Trott originally built Movable Type for Mena's personal use. While Blogger was easy to use, it was limited in its functionality - it lacked post titles, rich text editing, and categories, for example - so the Trotts set out to create something different for [Mena's blog] (http://www.dollarshort.org/). In 2001, they were both laid off from their jobs. With time on their hands they were able to refine their tool and make it ready to bring to the masses. In October, they launched Movable Type and it quickly became the most popular blogging platform, used by many of the major blogs at the time, including Instapundit, Wonkette, and Boing Boing. In many ways, Movable Type raised the bar for blogging platforms. It was not simply a publishing platform, but was a publishing platform that people wanted to use. Anil Dash is quoted [in Salon] (http://www.salon.com/2004/08/09/six_apart/) saying, "The very first thing that caught my eye was that it was very elegant. I said 'I want my site to look like that.' It was elegant all the way through, and the features — really basic stuff, like I wanted comments and categories and titles on my posts. I mean that wasn’t a common thing then, you couldn’t put a title on your post. Really basic stuff like that, and they got all that together in one tool, in a way that worked."

Once bloggers were able to publish online using tools like Blogger and Movable Type, the next step was for the tools to evolve. The tools needed to be better, and communication and sharing needed to improve. Publishing content just wasn't enough. Blogrolls were an early example of this functionality. Blogrolls were lists of blogs that the blog author read. They would typically display them in their sidebar. It served two purposes: to display the blogging tribe you belonged to, and to give "link love" to the author’s favorite blogs.

Permalinks and Trackbacks were two early developments in blogging. _Permalink_ is a portmanteau of _permanent link_ - it points to the specific blog post in the archive. With the rise of blogging, webpages went from being static to dynamic. A blog entry would only be on the front page of the site for a short period of time. Permalinks enabled visitors to have a direct link to the article that they could use to return to. Trackbacks are a linkback method Six Apart introduced in Movable Type. A trackback is a ping sent from a site that links to another. The site that receives the ping can publish the acknowledgement on their website. This was a way to facilitate communication between blogs. If a blogger had written about your article, they could send a trackback.

These changes and improvements were iterative steps toward bringing people together from totally different backgrounds, in different locations — providing them with a virtual locale in which they could create, work together, and sometimes produce something unexpected. WordPress’ creation is one of those moments when, in a small pocket of the internet, the right people connected. They may have been from completely different backgrounds, but a shared love on creating tools, playing with code, and publishing online, brought them together.

Matt was born in Houston, Texas on January 11th, 1984. His parents Chuck and Kathe, already had one daughter, Charleen, who was ten years old when Matt was born.

His early blog posts reflect his interests while at school, and later at University. As promised in his first post, he wrote about politics, economics, and technology. Over time his focus shifted; while at University he wrote about philosophy, then shifted more and more toward technology. Entries deal with web standards, coding, and ongoing debates in the technology world.  Interspersed within that are personal posts about the health of his cat, his nights out with friends, and, for a short period of time, a [large amount of puns] (http://ma.tt/2002/10/punaday-10/). Woven into the mix are Matt’s early passions - jazz music and photography.

Twenty-two years earlier, and nearly five thousand miles away, Mike Little was born in Manchester, UK, in 1962. He was brought up by his adoptive parents and their daughters, who were ten years older than he. His father worked in a factory and his mother was a doctor’s receptionist. The family lived rent-free in the house over the doctor’s surgery. Despite always doing well at school, when he reached sixth form, Mike lost interest in his academic studies and dropped out of school. His first job was at a TV aerial installation company where he wired electronics, but his growing passion was music. It is in music and computing where Matt and Mike, despite their different backgrounds, start to share similarities. For both of them, music was one of the elements that led to their work online. Both had earlier experience with computers, but it was music that propelled them further along that path.
  
Matt's interest in computers began when he was a kid. His father, Chuck, was a computer programmer and there were always computers in the house. His first computing experience was an Atari game called - Winnie the Pooh and the Hundred Acre Wood. He graduated from these to role-playing games such as Ultima online. His computer experience developed as he got older. On _take your son to work day_, and on occasional Saturdays, Chuck took Matt to work with him and Matt played around on computers all day. He started learning to take computers apart and put them back together.

While he was at high school Matt started to make money from computers. While studying at the High School for the Performing and Visual Arts (HSVPA), he got interested in building computers and websites. He built computers for his saxaphone teacher, David Caceres and other musicians around Houston. He graduated from building computers to building websites. Under the business name [SWC] (http://web.archive.org/web/20020401182611/http://www.swcdesign.com/) he built websites for local companies, including [David Caceres] (http://web.archive.org/web/20020329153221/http://davidcaceres.com/). While at school he connected with other music fans in the Houston area on the internet. He set up a [forum on David Caceres'] (http://web.archive.org/web/20020202222327/http://davidcaceres.com/forum/) website. To ask questions and learn more about building websites, he signed up for SitePoint, where he was active on the forums under the username [allusion] (http://www.sitepoint.com/forums/member.php?12622-allusion), a username that would stay with him through the first few years of the WordPress.org forums.

Mike also reached computing via music. His very first exposure, however, to computers did not work out so well. While in sixth form at school, he had a free period each week during which he could choose what to do. He and some friends decided to go to the local college and try programming. At that point there wasn’t even a screen - the boys typed on a keyboard and output spat out the back on printed paper. One of Mike's friends decided to use his time on the computer to smoke. The boys got caught — the teacher was furious that they had smoked around so much paper, and this brought Mike's very first foray into programming to a close.

He returned to programming, however, in 1982. The music scene in Manchester and Stockport in the late 1970s and early 1980s was thriving.  An influential performance by The Sex Pistols at the Lesser Free Trade Hall fuelled Manchester’s music scene. People like Peter Hook and Bernard Sumner (Joy Division), Morrissey (The Smiths), and Tony Wilson (Factory Records) were in the audience. It was in this punk, post-punk, and new wave atmosphere that Mike gave up his aerial job and started working in a record shop. At the center of the music scene, he was able to get gig tickets and saw Joy Division and Cabaret Voltaire. He handed out ‘zines for then-don of the Manchester music scene, Tony Wilson.

During that period, Mike lived with a local band called Belgian Bitch, and it was through them that computing came back into his life. Glam rock was the new thing, and the lead singer thought it would be cool to have stacks of televisions with graphics on either side of the stage. Mike borrowed a ZX Spectrum and used a couple of programs from  computing magazines: one of them bounced objects around the screen, the second created 3D text. He hacked until he got the words he wanted to bounce around a screen, but the plan finally fell flat when they couldn’t figure out how to output the program to multiple screens at the same time. Despite not being a total success, this incident further cemented his reputation for being the go-to guy for all things computing and music.

Mike's first programming experience took place twenty years before he met Matt. The music scene in Manchester eventually went on a long hiatus but Mike continued to learn to program. He moved onto an 8bit Atari, and started programming using Emacs on a 16bit Atari ST. It was when he was running a video rental shop that he finally bought a PC. Bought for running the shop, it was a 640k monochrome computer (also known as a green screen) with a 20mb hard drive, that cost £3,000. Mike got himself a copy of Turbo Pascal on some 5.25 inch floppies, installed it, and taught himself programming in earnest.

He fell in love with programming, enjoying the challenges, and problem solving. He learned Basic, 6502 Assembler, Pascal, and Object-Oriented Pascal, and then learned C on production software once he started coding professionally. He learned PHP, the language which WordPress would be written in, during the transition between PHP versions one and two. PHP often gets criticized, but for Mike, much of it is unwarranted. “I know a lot of languages now,” he says “They're all just syntax for me. Any modern language - so anything in the last 20 years - allows you to write good code. Many of them allow you to write really crap code as well. People who complain about PHP as if it forces you to write bad code either don't understand that beginners will always write bad code no matter what language they use or they haven't got the discipline to write good code.”

With his experience of PHP, b2 was the natural platform for Mike to start blogging with. For one, it was written in PHP with a MySQL database. For another, it was licensed under the GNU General Public License, a free software license that encouraged software distribution and hacking. Mike had already contributed to open source projects, such as MySQL, was a follower of the author of the GPL, Richard Stallman, and was an advocate of free software. The other open source platform that was available at that time, [Greymatter] (http://www.greymatterforums.com/), was written in Perl and wasn't easy to install. For Matt, too, a platform written in PHP made more sense than using the Perl-based Movable Type - Matt had already had experience hacking PHP when working on the forums for David Caceres. It wasn't long, therefore, after setting up his blog that he shifted platforms from Movable Type.

b2 was the platform that connected Matt and Mike. It was through publishing hacks and tips on their blogs, and encountering each other on the support forums, that they had their first interactions. And it is in b2 that we can find the origins of WordPress, before it was WordPress, and before Matt or Mike had considered writing their own blogging software. In June 2001, before either of them had written their first blog post, a developer in Corsica started [development of his own blogging platform] (http://zengun.org/weblog/archives/2001/06/post1958/). He touted it as a "PHP+MySQL alternative to Blogger and Greymatter." It's in that post that WordPress' history truly begins, 18 months before any talk of forks, before anyone had thought that combining the words "Word" and "Press" was a suitable name for a blogging platform. It's not in Stockport or Houston that WordPress' roots entirely lie — the real beginning was miles away on the French island of Corsica.
