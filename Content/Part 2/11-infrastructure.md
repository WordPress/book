Much of the discussion about WordPress 1.2 went on in the support forums, the IRC chat rooms, and via private chat and email. But the community was getting larger, both in terms of its user base and its development community. The switchers from Movable Type had widened WordPress’ user base, the introduction of internationalization made WordPress more usable worldwide,  and the introduction of the plugin system had created a platform that was much easier for developers to extend. The growing community needed more diverse communication channels with which to manage development and provide support to users. 

While many community members were happy with just the forums and IRC, many developers wanted a mailing list. This was particularly the case for developers who had experience with other FOSS projects. A mailing list is one of the most important communication tools in a FOSS project and WordPress lacked one. It took more than a year after the project’s inception for WordPress’ developer infrastructure to properly take shape. The [FAQ on WordPress.org reflects the approach to development at the time](https://web.archive.org/web/20040402000122/http://wordpress.org/docs/faq/):	
> _I am a programmer/designer/hacker — can I help with the development of WP?_	
> Sure you can! Post your suggestions and requests for features in the forums. Design or alter some hacks to add functionality to the WP suite of tools. Got some cool ideas on an innovative design? By all means, build it and show it off! If you want to be directly involved in the daily development of WP, the best way is to show your competence by building clean hacks or patches that conform to the developer guidelines. Once you have some code out there, contact Matt and he’ll talk to you about getting you involved more directly with development.	

That was the process: post on the forums, write about it on your blog, email the lead developers. There wasn’t a clear, single, entry point which developers could go to. The forum [failed to provide the proper infrastructure that developers were used to on FOSS projects](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/development-culture-at-wp?replies=21). [Ryan Boren, who  was still new to the project, had experience of Linux development. He posted to the thread](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/development-culture-at-wp?replies=21#post-7523: 

> Communities are built around development mailing lists. That's where the bazaar really takes place. A BB [bulletin board] isn't nearly as good for sending and reviewing patches, performing UI reviews, and so forth. The BB is a nice resource that has its purpose, but a mailing list is better suited to development traffic. I would much rather use my favorite email client with its editing, sorting, and filtering capabilities than any web BB. Plus, the mail comes to me, not me to it.	
> Right now, I send all of my patches directly to Matt. I hope he gets them. If there was a development mailer, I would send the patches there so all interested parties could give them a look and see what people are working on.	
There was, in fact, a mailing list, but it was a private one in which Matt, Mike, and the other developers communicated on. It wasn’t publicly archived and it wasn’t possible for anyone to get involved with the discussion. There were no plans to create a public mailing list as, at the time, they preferred development discussion to take place on the WordPress forums. 

That discussion thread contains the seed of what would increasingly become a point of contention for some in the WordPress community - the division between people who didn’t write code and people who did. A developer mailing list would segregate the community into different groups - on the one hand developers and on the other everyone else. “It's exactly the mentality that causes most OS projects to become these developer-heavy, 'in-the-know' kind of places that make them unpleasant (and unapproachable) for the average user,” [wrote Cena](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/development-culture-at-wp?replies=21#post-7536). 


But with a growing developer base a mailing list was inevitable. Developer mailing lists are one of the primary communication tools for most FOSS projects. They provide a way for developers to communicate with each other, discussing features and changes, and are often participated in by more advanced users who either have questions about the product or who want to answer the questions of others. They serve a different role to an IRC chat room. To participate in a chat room, a person needs to be online at the time that discussion takes place. They can follow up by reading logs (if the chat room is logged), but that’s after-the-fact. 

A mailing list provides a distributed way for developers to communicate with one another from their email inbox. Everyone can participate in the conversations that take place. It enables them to ask questions about development, review patches, and discuss new features. A developer can send a patch to the mailing list and anyone can review it, it helps to prevent the bottlenecks that come when a patch is sent privately to a developer and sits in their inbox waiting for review. They support the bazaar-style development of a FOSS project, providing a platform where the hubbub of development discussion can take place.

 The first mailing list in the project, however, wasn’t wp-hackers, but wp-docs which was [set up in November 2003](https://web.archive.org/web/20090107221645/http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/docs/2003-November/000000.html) for discussion about WordPress’ documentation and wiki. It was active for 6 months before the [hackers mailing list](http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/hackers/) was set up. This was later moved to [wp-hackers](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/). Development discussion moved from the support forums and on to the mailing list, leaving the forums as a place to provide support. 

The wp-hackers mailing list exploded with activity, busy with heated discussions about issues such as [whether comment links should be nofollow](http://plugins.lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/hackers/2005-January/003617.html) to discourage spammers, [the best way to format the date](http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/hackers/2004-August/001335.html), [how to start translating WordPress](http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/hackers/2004-December/003462.html). It provided a place for developers to congregate and discuss issues. They embraced the new communication platform, now having a small corner for themselves within the project.

As predicted in the 2003 support forum discussion, the mailing list further cemented the division between those who were providing support (whether in the form of answering support tickets or writing documentation) and those writing the code. People writing code often aren’t interested in providing support - they just want to be solving code problems. But those providing support sometimes need the input of those who write the code. It [frustrated many support forum volunteers](http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/hackers/2004-July/000962.html) that the project’s developers weren’t available to help out. 

Still, wp-hackers became an important place for WordPress development, particularly during the project’s early growth. As is the general trend with mailing lists, it became less useful over time, but for the first few years after it was launched there was ongoing discussion about WordPress development. Many important features were discussed and many important debates were had. And it was the place where many of today’s developers had there first taste of WordPress.

The other development resource that appeared around this time was the first WordPress repository. The [WordPress Plugin Repository](http://wordpress.org/news/2005/01/the-wordpress-plugin-repository/) was launched in January 2005. Hosted at dev.wp-plugins.org, and powered subversion and trac, it’s quite different to the user-friendly plugin directory that we’re used to today. The plugin repository literally was just a repository for code. 

In order to make it a little more accessible, the wiki was used to create a very early version of the Plugin Directory.

While being full of tools for developers, didn’t have an easy user interface that would help users to find the plugins that they need. Trac and wikis can often be difficult for non-technical software users to navigate. Users just want to get what they want, easily, and interfaces that look code-heavy can be confusing and off-putting. This was, however, a step that nurtured the FOSS community’s inclination towards code sharing, and moved in the direction of creating a plugin directory hosted on WordPress.org.
