## 12. Themes

The next area ripe for improvement was templating - users could extend their blog, and have it in their own language, but they still wanted to easily change the site’s design. Even in the b2 forums, many support questions were about changing a website’s design. A blog is a visual representation of the author, their tastes, and their interests - a blog is a home on the internet, and, just with any home, owners decorate it according to their own tastes. To change the look of a b2 or early WordPress blog, the user had to create a CSS stylesheet. This changed the colors and layout on the front end. However, it didn’t offer any real flexibility in site design; a robust templating system was needed. Michel had looked into creating a templating system for b2 but it was in the transition between WordPress 1.2 and 15 that WordPress got its theme system. 

There was lots of research into best templating system to use. One that came up again and again was Smarty templates. Smarty is a PHP templating system that allows the front-end to be changed independently of the back-end, so the front-end design can be changed without having to worry about the rest of the application. There [are a number of posts](http://wordpress.org/news/2003/04/smarty-and-smarttemplate/) on the [WordPress.org development blog](http://wordpress.org/news/2003/04/smarty-and-smarttemplate/) discussing the merits of Smarty. [Donncha even imported it to the repository](http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/530) (his first commit to the project). But, despite sharing the PHP language with WordPress, Smarty had a difficult syntax to learn. In the end [it was rejected as being too complicated](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/smarty-the-templating-system-that-came-from-hell?replies=6#post-22474). WordPress needed was a system as easy to use as the software itself. 


While discussion about templating systems continued, WordPress users got creative with CSS stylesheets. To make switching designs easy, Alex King wrote a [CSS Style Switcher](http://alexking.org/blog/2004/01/20/wordpress-css-style-switcher) hack, which came with three CSS stylesheets. Not everyone who had a WordPress blog wanted to create their own stylesheet, and many didn’t know how. There needed to be a pool of stylesheets that users had access to. To grow the number of stylesheets available, Alex ran a WordPress [CSS Style competition](http://alexking.org/blog/2004/01/25/wordpress-css-style-competition). Prizes, donated by members of the community, were offered for the top three stylesheets; $70, $35, and $10. 

The other aim of the stylesheet competition was to create a resource similar to the popular [CSS Zen Garden](http://csszengarden.com). Just as CSS Zen Garden showed off the flexibility of CSS, a repository of CSS stylesheets would show off the flexibility of WordPress.

The competition created buzz in the community. In total, there were 38 submissions. The winner of the first competition was Naoko Takano, with her entry Pink Lillies:

The competition was successful in the aim of widening the pool of available stylesheets, increasing the number from 7 to 45. On his website, Alex launched a [style browser for looking through all of the different stylesheets](http://alexking.org/projects/wordpress/styles/sample.php?wpstyle=pink_lilies). The competition [was run again in 2005](http://alexking.org/blog/2005/02/27/wordpress-theme-competition), this time receiving more than a hundred submissions. 

By the time of the second competition, the theme system was in place and designers had more tools to design and build their theme. Alex’s experience in the second competition, however, foreshadowed problems that would dog the community in later years. In hosting 138 themes on his site, [Alex had to review all of the code](http://alexking.org/blog/2005/03/28/theme-competition) to make sure there was nothing malicious, and to ensure that the theme adhered to coding best practices. He decided not to host the competition again in 2006 due to the sheer amount of workload. WordPress’ growth meant there would be even more submissions, far too much for one person to review. This would be an ongoing problem as the project continued to grow: how does one balance a low barrier to entry with achieving good code quality, particularly in third party plugins and themes?


Still, the 2005 competition showed off the flexibility of the brand new theme system, which appeared  in February 2005 [fn^1], in WordPress 1.5. In the end, the theme system was built using PHP which is, after all, a templating language itself. Using a PHP template tag system had the advantage of being fast and easy, particularly for WordPress developers and designers who were learning about PHP. It was "cheap and easy, and well-known and portable," says Ryan. The theme system breaks a theme down into its component parts - header, footer, sidebar, for example. Each part is an individual file which a designer can customize and then use template tags to call different elements to display on the front end. The bundle of files is a WordPress theme. A native WordPress theme system, as opposed to a templating system such as Smarty, meant that designers could design and build themes without learning an entirely new syntax.


Bundled with WordPress 1.5 was a new default theme - an adapted version of Michael Heilemann’s Kubrick. While some welcomed the new theme, [others were unhappy that it was chosen:](https://web.archive.org/web/20041016090654/http://binarybonsai.com/archives/2004/08/22/kubrick-vs-wordpress/)

One of the problems with Kubrick was that it contained images; if a user wanted to make changes to their theme they had to use an external image editor. Some felt that users should be expected to download additional software just to change their site’s design. Other complaints were that it was too complex, it had .htaccess issues, and that there were other (better) themes that could be chosen. The [thread on the forums] (https://wordpress.org/support/topic/why-using-kubrick-on-13-is-a-mistake) reaches five pages with flames thrown all over the place. 

These types of fires ignite quickly in bazaar style development. They can get out of hand, with people taking their opinion to their blogs and social media. As with many debates in Free Software communities, it burned ferociously for a short time before fizzling out. But the brief outbreak portended later debates about WordPress themes. There’s something about these that ignite people’s passions more than most other aspects of WordPress. 

Still, by the release of WordPress 1.5, the software had two of the elements that define the project and the community: themes and plugins. These two improvements transformed WordPress from standalone software into an extensible platform. Extensibility creates the right conditions for an ecosystem to flourish. If a product is solid and attracts a lot of users then developers will follow, extending the software and building tools for it. The theme and plugin systems made this possible, in both design and features. It also meant that some developers could focus on improving the core product while others could go off and work on their own pet project. Core developers could focus on refining the software into something that millions of people wanted to use.

[fn^1] WordPress versions were skipped between 1.2 and 1.5. This was due to the length of time between the two releases.
