With WordPress now much easier to extend and to translate, the next stage was to provide a way for people to easily change the front-end design of their website. Even in the b2 forums, a lot of the questions that people had were around changing a website’s look. WordPress users wanted their blogs to be a representation of themselves, their tastes, and their interests - a blog was a home on the internet, and just with any home, the owners wanted to decorate it according to their own tastes. In order to change the look of a b2 or early WordPress blog, the user had to create a CSS stylesheet. This would change the colours and layout on the front end. However, it didn’t offer any real flexibility in site design and it was clear that some sort of templating system was needed. Michel had been thinking about creating a templating system for b2 but it was in the transition between WordPress 1.2 and 1.5 that WordPress got its theme system. 

There were a lot of discussions about the best templating system to use. One that came up again and again was Smarty templates. Smarty is a PHP templating system that simplifies compartmentalization, allowing the front end to be changed independently of the back end. This sort of templating system makes it easy for someone to change their front-end design without having to worry about the rest of the application. There [are a number of posts](http://wordpress.org/news/2003/04/smarty-and-smarttemplate/) on the [WordPress.org development blog](http://wordpress.org/news/2003/04/smarty-and-smarttemplate/) discussing the merits of Smarty. There was much going back and forth, with the project settling on Smarty and [Donncha importing it to the repository](http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/530) (his first commit to the project). But, despite sharing the PHP language with WordPress, Smarty had a difficult syntax to learn. In the end [it was rejected as being too complicated](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/smarty-the-templating-system-that-came-from-hell?replies=6#post-22474). What was needed was a system as easy to use as WordPress itself. 


While discussion was continuing about which templating system to use, WordPress users continued to get creative with CSS stylesheets. To allow users to change their design quickly, Alex King wrote a [CSS Style Switcher](http://alexking.org/blog/2004/01/20/wordpress-css-style-switcher) hack. This came with three CSS stylesheets. Not everyone who had a WordPress blog wanted to create their own stylesheet, and many didn’t know how. With its low barrier to entry, there needed to be more stylesheets that people could quickly change out. To grow the number of stylesheets available, Alex ran a WordPress [CSS Style competition](http://alexking.org/blog/2004/01/25/wordpress-css-style-competition). Prizes, donated by members of the community, were offered for the top three stylesheets; $70, $35, and $10. 

The other aim of the stylesheet competition was to create a resource similar to the popular [CSS Zen Garden](http://csszengarden.com). Just as CSS Zen Garden showed off the flexibility of CSS, a repository of CSS stylesheets would show off the flexibility of WordPress.

The competition created a considerable buzz around the community. In total, 38 submissions were received. The winner of the first competition was Naoko Takano, with her entry Pink Lillies:

The competition was successful in the aim of widening the pool of available stylesheets, increasing the number from 7 to 45. On his website, Alex launched [style browser for looking through all of the different stylesheets](http://alexking.org/projects/wordpress/styles/sample.php?wpstyle=pink_lilies). The competition was a success, and [it was run again in 2005](http://alexking.org/blog/2005/02/27/wordpress-theme-competition), this time receiving more than a hundred submissions. 

By the time of the second competition, the theme system was already in place and designers had more tools when it came to designing and building their theme. Alex’s experience in the second competition, however, was a foreshadowing of problems that would dog the community in later years. In hosting all of the 138 themes on his site, [Alex had to review all of the code](http://alexking.org/blog/2005/03/28/theme-competition) to make sure it didn’t contain anything malicious and to ensure that the theme adhered to coding best practices. He decided not to host the competition again in 2006 due to the sheer amount of workload. WordPress’ growth meant there would be even more submissions, far too much for one person to review. This would be an ongoing problem as the project continued to grow: how does one balance a low barrier to entry with achieving good code quality, particularly in third party plugins and themes?


Still, the 2005 competition showed off the flexibility of the brand new theme system, which appeared in WordPress 1.5 in February 2005 [fn^1]. In the end, the theme system was built using PHP which is, after all, a templating language itself. Using a PHP template tag system had the advantage of being fast and easy, particularly for WordPress developers and designers who were learning about PHP. It was "cheap and easy, and well-known and portable," says Ryan. The theme system broke a theme down into its component parts - header, footer, sidebar, for example. Each part was an individual file which a designer could customize and then use template tags to call different elements to display on the front end. The bundle of these files was a WordPress theme. By extending WordPress itself to make it a templating system, designers could achieve what they wanted without having to learn something new, such as Smarty.


Bundled with WordPress 1.5 was a new default theme - an adapted version of Michael Heilemann’s Kubrick. While some people welcomed the new theme, [others were unhappy that it was chosen:](https://web.archive.org/web/20041016090654/http://binarybonsai.com/archives/2004/08/22/kubrick-vs-wordpress/)

<img alt="Kubrick Theme" src="../../Resources/images/themes/kubrick.jpg" />

One of the problems that community members had with Kubrick was that it contained images; if a user wanted to make changes to their theme they would need to use an external image editor. Other complaints were that it was too complex, it had .htaccess issues, and that there were other (better) themes that could be chosen. The [thread on the forums] (https://wordpress.org/support/topic/why-using-kubrick-on-13-is-a-mistake) reaches five pages with flames thrown all over the place. 

These types of fires can ignite quickly in a bazaar style of development. They can get out of hand quickly, with people taking to their blogs and social media to get their opinion. As with many debates in FOSS communities, it burned ferociously for a few weeks before fizzling out. But the brief outbreak of anger anticipated the debates that would surround themes in WordPress’ future. There’s something about these that ignites people’s passions more than most other aspects of WordPress. 

Still, by the release of WordPress 1.5, the project had two of the elements that have really come to define the project and the community: themes and plugins. These two improvements transformed WordPress from a standalone platform into something extensible. Extensibility creates good conditions for an ecosystem to flourish around a product. If a product is solid and attracts a lot of users then developers will follow to extend the product and build tools for it. The theme and plugin systems made extending WordPress possible, both in terms of design and functionality. They also meant that some developers could focus on improving the core product while others could go off and work on their own pet project, and the core developers could really focus on refining the product to be something that millions of users would want to use.



[fn^1] WordPress versions were skipped between 1.2 and 1.5. This was due to the length of time between the two releases.
