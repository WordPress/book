## 20. Growing Pains

In January 2006, a Google authoring survey showed that [WordPress powered 0.8% of websites](http://ma.tt/2006/01/markup-survey/). This growth in usage meant that the project grew too, and with that growth came growing pains. This isn’t uncommon for any organization, but especially for bazaar-style communities in which everyone is encouraged to participate and have a voice. Every free software project experiences conflict. In the end what matters isn’t the specifics of that conflict but how the conflict is resolved and how the project moves on. Many of the difficulties within the WordPress project come down to a few broad issues: different approaches to development and community building, communication, and differences of emphasis about who the software is for - users or developers, for example, or users and business owners. Tensions arose from the wealth of different backgrounds of contributors - formally taught developers, self-taught hackers, designers, people doing support and writing docs, business owners and bloggers. Diversity is one of WordPress’ strengths, but it doesn’t come without challenges, and it’s along these frontiers that many issues in the project have arisen.

While the Shuttle project worked in private, contributors were concerned that work was going on behind closed doors. They felt cut out of an important part of the development process. This was compounded by the lack of clarity about what the Shuttle group was and what they were responsible for. Some people were convinced that the Shuttle group was redesigning the admin while the rest of the community were cut out of it, although [Matt relayed that](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2005-June/001417.html) "Shuttle is a few designers who throw photoshop comps back and forth to each other."

Co-founder Mike Little was one of those vexed by the process. In June 2005, [changes were checked in to the write screen](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/2639) that implemented the new pods functionality, enabling users to collapse and expand meta boxes on the screen. The changes weren't discussed ahead of time on wp-hackers or IRC, just on the closed wp-design mailing list. This precipitated a long discussion on wp-hackers about [openness in the project](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2005-June/001403.html). While Matt intended the commit to be a discussion point, it was perceived to be a wholesale change made without discussion. Many in the community felt that discussion should happen ahead of the commit, or that the community should at least have been informed that the user interface design has been delegated to the Shuttle group. That was, after all, how an free software project should work. 

Discussions in the [WordPress IRC chat room](http://codex.wordpress.org/IRC_Meetups/2005/June/June29RawLog) focused on the fact of only Matt and Ryan had commit access. All issues had to go through them. Discussions were had about how to make the process more open.  As a result both Mark Jaquith and Sean Evans (morydd) were made bug gardeners and given maximum privileges on trac. 

Another area which causeds heated debated was inline documentation. There was strong support in the community to improve WordPress' inline documentation. For many developers, digging into the code is the best learning tool that they have. In February 2006, Rich Bowen ([drbacchus](https://profiles.wordpress.org/drbacchus) proposed [that he document WordPress' functions](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-February/004921.html) and asked if there was a philosophical objection to having inline documentation.  [The response from Carthik was that](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-February/004926.html) it was frowned upon because it would lead to bloat. He referred to a thread from May 2005, [which said](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2005-May/001114.html):

> Commenting is tricky. Some "well-commented" code I've seen had a bunch  of lines of repetitive filler that "documented" what you could easily see by just looking at the code itself and doubled the size of the program. APIs should be documented religiously, but I think spending a ton of time on redundant comments for code only a few core hackers will ever look at will bloat the codebase and waste everyone's time. I also  believe that well-written code usually doesn't need comments unless it's doing some sort of voodoo or workaround.

The proposal, however, had wide support across the community, and some developers offering to [take on the labor themselves](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-February/005084.html). Rich's initial proposal started a long discussion about the best way to generate documentation from the code and the best format for inline documentation, but it was [ultimately didn’t go anywhere.](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-February/005088.html) Matt argued that documentation shouldn't be auto-generated, pointing to the Codex as the best place for documentation.

Over the coming months there [continued to be support for inline documentation in the community](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-March/005481.html). [Tickets were opened but left ignored](http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2473), and Owen Winkler created his own [developer function reference](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-April/005534.html)

The end of the inline docs proposal made many community members unhappy. Scott Merrill ([Skippy](http://profiles.wordpress.org)) wrote a long post on the wp-forums mailing list, [in which he outlined his issues with the project](http://codex.wordpress.org/IRC_Meetups/2006/February/February22RawLog). The docs at that time, were not in a good condition. After the first flurry of activity on the docs mailing list, activity died down and some months saw [barely any posts at all](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-docs/2006-May/thread.html). The documentation did continue to grow but in a haphazard and messy way. Using a poorly-managed wiki as a host for documentation that should be inline would only make matters worse. 

This tension was between those from a traditional coding background and those from the self-taught hacker background that so much embodies WordPress’ culture. While the line isn’t clear-cut, many of the original WordPress developers were entirely self taught. The get-it-on-the-screen approach pioneered by Michel in b2 continued to filter down through the project, often at the expense of coding practices that more experienced developers took for granted. Inline documentation was seen by some as superfluous to writing code, considered even to be bloat as it increased the file size. It would take some time before it became standard practice in the WordPress community, though when it did there were community members who pushed hard to get WordPress properly documented. 

The documentation problems weren't limited to inline documentation. Mark Riley (Podz) one of WordPress' longstanding forum moderators, [pointed out in 2006](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-forums/2006-March/001530.html) that the WordPress Codex was failing users. For example, it was [recommended on the Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/index.php?title=Hardening_WordPress&oldid=16988) that users hide which version of WordPress they were running, but the code itself contained a comment asking users to leave the information for statistical purposes. Mark also complained that the content in the Codex meant nothing to WordPress users. He cites a section on permissions which sats "All files should be owned by your user account, and should be writable by you. Any file that needs write access from WordPress should be group-owned by the user account used by the webserver." With such a low barrier to entry for users the documentation needed to be written in a language that they would understand

These discussions highlighted the tension between developers and non-developers on the project. WordPress encouraged people from all backgrounds to get involved with the project but developers weren’t always interested in supporting them. This chimes with the free software do-it-yourself attitude. Many developers in the project were self taught - if they could get to grips with the intricacies of PHP why couldn’t others? The relationship between developers and the support team is played out on the wp-hackers mailing list. Again and again, Mark Riley posts to the mailing list with questions that come up on the support forums, trying to get help from developers. There is a sense of frustration as he tries to get the answers from the developers that the users need.

A clear fault line was release dates. Almost every release cycle, Mark asked to be informed of the release date in advance so that he could ensure that the support forums were properly manned when the new version came out. Again and again, a release would arrive with him unaware of it. "All I am trying - and yet again complete failing - to ask,"  [he asked on the mailing list](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-March/005310.html) "is that IF you want support for the product it would nice to at least let the forums know. You guys just don't see it do you? You really don't have a clue." This feeling of frustration can often be observed as community members try to get the information that they need to properly support WordPress users. 

These sorts of challenges are unsurprising when so many people come together to work on a project. A free software project is a melting pot of people with different ideas, opinions, and backgrounds. Conventional wisdom says that this approach to running a project and creating software shouldn’t work, but somehow it does. Despite the challenges that come with the bazaar-style model, people stick around and help the software and the project to grow.
