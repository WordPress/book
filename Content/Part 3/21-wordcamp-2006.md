## 21. WordCamp 2006

The WordPress community has a long tradition of getting together. Even before WordPress held official events, there were small gatherings of WordPress community members and users. The first of these was [in June 2004, in San Francisco](https://wordpress.org/news/2004/06/meetup-location/). As well as meeting up to socialize, [people also got together to hold upgrade parties](https://wordpress.org/news/2005/02/upgrade-party/). These were held before the days of the one-click upgrade, when users had to upgrade their sites using FTP. As well as helping users to upgrade, contributors also helped people to migrate from other platforms to WordPress.

Many free software projects have their own dedicated user conferences. These are places where members of the community can get together to learn, talk about the software, and socialize. Matt, along with Tantek Çelik, had been involved in setting up another conference series - barcamp. Barcamps are informal, user-generated conferences that are focused on web technologies. They’re normally open, and workshop-style, with all of the attendees participating in the creation of the schedule. In July 2006, Matt announced that he would be [holding a Barcamp style event called WordCamp](http://ma.tt/2006/07/wordcamp/). "BarCamp-style" is a code phrase for "last minute.”” [he wrote on his blog](http://ma.tt/2006/07/wordcamp/).

On 9th July he announced that the event would be on 5th August, and as yet he had no venue or schedule. When they did get a venue, it was the Swedish American Hall. More than 500 people signed up for the event, with people flying in from all over the world: Donncha flew in from Ireland and Mark Riley from the UK. As well as attending the WordCamp, those who had started work at Automattic got together for a meetup to work on some Automattic projects.

The [schedule for the WordCamp](http://2006.wordcamp.org/schedule/) reflects the concerns of the project at the time and also the breadth of people involved in the project. Mark Riley gave the first ever presentation at a WordCamp on how to get involved with the project. These are a staple of many WordCamps as community members try to get user inspired to help out. Andy Skelton presented on the widgets feature that he was working on for WordPress.com. There were presentations about blogging and podcasting, about journalism and monetising your blog. Donncha spoke about WPMU, and Mark Jaquith presented on [WordPress as a CMS](http://markjaquith.com/wordcamp/wordpress-versatility/), which he later reported was [one of the most-requested sessions](http://markjaquith.wordpress.com/2006/08/30/wordcamp-thoughts-late-to-the-game/).

WordCamp San Francisco 2006 was the first WordCamp at which Matt did his State of the Word presentation. This has become a feature of every WordCamp San Francisco. Matt talks about what’s happened in the past year and what’s upcoming for WordPress. In the first State of the Word, he [talked about how](http://dan.hersam.com/2006/08/05/wordcamp-notes/) the software needed to be kept simple. The plan was to make installation a lot simpler, and to make themes and the admin page more usable. He mentioned Mark Riley, who had been extremely helpful on the support forums, and said that documentation and support needed a lot more contributors. One of the major issues hit on by Matt, and discussed in the Q&A afterwards, was updates. Matt made reference to Firefox, which could easily let people know that there was a new release. In order to be aware of a WordPress update, users had to follow the development blog. WordPress needed to be easy for people to update.

As well as the presentations, there was barbecue for lunch and a party in the evening, and the event, despite the short lead time, was a success. It was the first of a WordCamp movement that ignited in countries across the world. The second WordCamp was in 2007, again in San Francisco in the Swedish American Hall. The first WordCamp outside of San Francisco was WordCamp Beijing in September 2007, which was quickly followed by WordCamps in Israel, Argentina, and Melbourne. These events, and WordPress events just like them, were organized by volunteers in the community who wanted to get WordPress users together to geek out on the software. In the beginning, there was no formal structure to the WordCamp program - if someone wanted to organize one they just did it. They were very informal user conferences, much like Barcamps themselves. It wasn’t until later, when the project had grown and the number of WordCamps across the world had exploded, that they started to get some structure.
