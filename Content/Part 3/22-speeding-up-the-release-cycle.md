## 22. Speeding up the Release Cycle

Shuttle wasn’t the only aspect of the project dragging on. More than a year elapsed between Shuttle-inspired WordPress 2.0 and the next version, WordPress 2.1. [Matt describes](http://ma.tt/2010/11/one-point-oh/) the year between 2.0 and 2.1 as “a dark time in WordPress development history, a lost year.”  

WordPress’ release cycle was often sporadic, particularly in those early days. Sometimes releases arrived every few months, other times longer. Between 1.2 and 1.5, for example, 265 days elapsed. The codebase had so many changes that they decided to skip a few version numbers, [going straight from 1.2 to 1.5](http://wordpress.org/news/2004/12/version-skip/). This was at a time when version numbers were attached to releases in a haphazard way. The project's approach is that the current release is the first two numbers, and each release is a major version. Versions 1.5, 2.0, 2.9, 3.4, and 4.0, for example, all have the same weighting as each other. Patch releases have an additional decimal point -- 2.0.1, for example. This differs from the approach taken by many other software projects. Drupal 6 and Drupal 7, for example, are major releases, but the releases with decimal points are not. WordPress uses this approach to avoid version inflation. Over a period of years, the software version number can quickly get high. Decimalization avoids that.

Between WordPress 1.5 and 2.0, however, the project hadn’t quite settled on its approach to version numbering. Version 1.6 was inflated to 2.0. partly because of the number of features in it, and because 314 days had elapsed between releases. But the delay between 2.0 (released December 31st, 2005) and 2.1 (released January 22nd, 2007) had been the longest so far.  

The mailing list was active, and more developers than ever were attracted to the project. WordPress itself was downloaded 1.5 million times. But while emails were being sent, no code was being shipped. The [release post for WordPress 2.1 with its a plethora of new features](http://wordpress.org/news/2007/01/ella-21/) demonstrates the problem. There wasn’t a rift in development or any major changes in the project, just a constant desire to slip in just one more feature, a refusal to wait for the next release. The release may have been packed with features but it took more than a year to get there. 

The delay frustrated developers not simply because the release cycle was taking so long but because commit access was still restricted to Matt and Ryan. For many developers, the development delays could partly be attributed to the restrictive commit policy. There was a clear difference in opinion about how commit access in the project should be managed. Every free software project approaches commit access differently, and in WordPress itself there was a mixture of people who supported the Linux-style commit policy and those who didn’t. Ryan argued that [ the funnel](http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-March/005192.html) avoided situations in which “bridge burning arguments happen in the repository rather than in ticket comments." This way, approach and implementation discussions took place before code touched the repository. Once code lands in the repository it’s hard to remove. An open commit policy brings its own challenges and some who’d been involved with open commit free software projects [supported the funnel](http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-March/005195.html). "Loose control leads to spaghetti code and flame wars over inconsequential issues," wrote Douglas Daulton, in a post to wp-hackers.

In the context of these discussions, Ryan [codified elements of the project’s process that remain part of the development process today](http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-March/005190.html):

- every commit must be accompanied by a ticket.
- before commit, the code is reviewed by at least two people -- one for a code review and the other for an integration/architecture review.
- these reviews are carried out by trusted contributors.

By March, 2006, incremental, positive changes were happening. Ryan suggested that a #wordpress-dev channel could help facilitate discussion around development. The #wordpress channel had become a place for general chatter and support. This meant that the focus wasn’t primarily on development. Mark Jaquith [pointed out the Bug Gardening scheme's success](http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-March/005189.html) which had started in 2005 during previous discussions about opening up commit. By opening up Trac privileges to “bug gardeners” who were responsible for triaging tickets the workload had become distributed, leading to "a whole slew of people who are autonomously fixing bugs, submitting  patches, and having them committed." The Trac mailing list was another positive change, which transformed Trac from simple bug-tracking software to a discussion locus. This kept discussion focused on specific tickets and issues, somewhat curtailing the tendency on wp-hackers for discussion to meander into rabbit holes. 

As work on WordPress 2.1 went on, Ryan posted to wp-hackers about [getting WordPress 2.0 into Debian stable](http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-October/008871.html). Debian is a free and open source operating system distribution. The stable version is the latest official version of the software. WordPress was already in the testing and unstable distributions which both contain packages lined up for inclusion in the stable version. To be included in the stable distribution, WordPress 2.0 would need to be maintained for three to five years. This involved backporting security issues to ensure that all versions remained stable. Mark Jaquith took on the task of maintaining the WordPress 2.0 branch. The project committed to maintaining the version for three years, until 2010. 

Shortly after he began leading the legacy branch, [Mark Jaquith received commit access](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/4270). Mark had been involved with WordPress since 2004, coming to the project from Movable Type. In his two-year involvement with the project, he’d made many contributions, including to the successful bug gardening scheme. It was a sign that the funnel was starting to broaden, and the beginning of a period when -- slowly but surely -- more committers were added.

Commit access was offered sparingly; it wasn’t just given out based on coding expertise or how much work a developer had done. Adding a new committer meant trusting them to uphold the project’s user-first ethos. Then, and now, that’s a key factor in deciding who is given commit access. “It’s not just that you’ve shown a commitment to contributing,” says Peter Westwood ([westi](http://profiles.wordpress.org/westi)) now, “but you also have shown an understanding of the ethos of the community and their shared beliefs, and their philosophies.”

Despite adding another committer, the development cycle wasn’t getting faster, and the team decided to look more seriously at the development process. Since WordPress’ first release, new versions had been arriving haphazardly, and as the number of users and developers grew, the outside impression was that things were somewhat chaotic. There was no real structure or development process. 

A discussion on [moving to a 120 Day release cycle](http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-October/008907.html) started on wp-hackers. Matt shared his thoughts on what a release should look like:	

> 2 months of crazy fun wild development where anything goes.
> 1 month of polishing things a little bit, and performance.
> Feature freeze.	
> 1 month of testing, with a public beta release at the beginning.	

The community’s response was positive. This provided a concrete deadline for them to work toward. Having shorter release cycles also meant that if a feature held up a release it could be pushed to the next one. In theory, this should prevent additional delays -- in practice this often depended on what the feature was, who had spearheaded it and how far along it was.

When WordPress 2.1 shipped, it was the first to launch with a concrete release date for the next version: [April 23rd for WordPress 2.2](http://wordpress.org/news/2007/01/ella-21/). The release date's publication meant that the project now had a firm deadline. Anyone who followed WordPress’ development would expect the next version on that date. A deadline, among some in the project, came to be seen as a promise to users -- a release date promise that users could plan around. The project didn’t quite make the next deadline but were only a few weeks off; WordPress 2.2 [released on May 16th, 2007](http://wordpress.org/news/2007/05/wordpress-22/).
