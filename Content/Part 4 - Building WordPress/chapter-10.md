The WordPress community is like many open source communities - it has its own internal dynamics, its own structure, its own outliers. As the product has grown in popularity so the community has changed in its dynamics, growing from a group of hackers working on their pet project to a diverse set of people representing groups that include designers, writers, users, translators, accessibility experts, and people who help out on the support forums. In 2012, 108 people from across the world gathered on Tybee Island, Georgia for the very first WordPress community summit. In the Tybee Wedding Chapel, a location made famous prior to WordPress for being the set of a Miley Cyrus film. That Monday, it wasn’t wedding bells that sounded from the chapel, but the hubbub of WordPress core developers and plugin developers, interface designers and user experience designers, themers, support forum moderators, entrepreneurs, writers, and bloggers, a cacophony of accents that ranged from Russian to Portuguese, Japanese to Texan. They were gathered for the first time as a community to discuss one thing: how can we make this product, this project, even better? 	

The community, like all communities, has had its dramas that seem inconsequential from the outside but that people fight for passionately. Bike sheds of immense proportions have been constructed, painted, and fallen. Some people get frustrated and leave the community, others form lasting friendships and take on key roles. One of WordPress’ strengths has always been the sense of community around it. With its user-focused outlook, people who want to make the web better for every user find themselves gravitating towards it. And its strength can sometimes be its weakness. It is seductive, and sometimes inward-looking, eschewing other tools in favour of the product that the community has created.	

This chapter will look at the growth of the community, particularly at the communication tools and channels that have facilitated that growth, and the distribution tools that have enabled the sharing of code and ideas that the community is built upon.	

One of the gathering points for the WordPress community has always been WordPress.org. It’s the location for the support forums, documentation, and code repositories. Over the years it’s evolved according to the community’s needs. As the community has grown so WordPress has grown too, with the plugin and theme repositories exploding, and new communication tools being created for the community.	

A longstanding component of WordPress.org has been the Codex. In December 2003, Matt launched a [wiki for WordPress’ documentation](http://wordpress.org/news/2003/12/wordpress-wiki/). FOSS projects often use wikis for their documentation. The advantage to a wiki is that anyone can easily edit the content. Some wikis require a login, others can be edited by anyone. The downside to using a wiki, particularly when building a content management system, is that contributors have to learn a new tool for creating content. Another problem with a wiki is that, without careful curation, it can become messy, out-of-date, and difficult to navigate.	

The original plan for documentation was to have “official” documentation on the website, and a community-generated wiki alongside. By April 2004 some work had been carried out on the main WordPress.org site. An [FAQ had been created](https://web.archive.org/web/20040402000122/http://wordpress.org/docs/faq/), as had some [template documentation](https://web.archive.org/web/20040411104706/http://wordpress.org/docs/template/). But the [majority of documentation was being written on the wiki](https://web.archive.org/web/20040323105321/http://wiki.wordpress.org/).	

Cena wrote on the news blog [that part of the problem](http://wordpress.org/news/2004/04/state-of-the-docs-address/) was that WordPress was changing all of the time, so it was hard to write stable docs. WordPress 1.2 was wildly different from 1.0, and both differed from 0.72. WordPress 1.2 introduced the plugin system, for example, which meant that the method developers used to extend WordPress was changing.	

The WordPress Codex continued to grow, and those who tried to maintain it found it difficult to keep under control. There was [no standardised way of creating new pages](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-docs/2005-February/000007.html) and no standardisation of titles. This meant that the Codex was becoming a bric-a-brac stand of documentation.	

Not all documentation ended up on the Codex. Community members also wrote on their blog - Mark Riley’s tamba2 blog, for example, was home to a number of popular tutorials. Other contributors started to post their tutorials on the support forums. Lorelle van Fossen [started posting her WordPress tutorials on the forums](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/lesson-designing-styles-for-contests) before later porting them over to the Codex.	

As the Codex grew, there were [ongoing discussions about what types of documentation to write](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-docs/2005-March/000160.html). Documentation comes in many different forms. It can be task-based, teaching a user how to do a specific thing. Or it can be reference-based, an article that someone can refer to when having trouble with a particular screen. The Codex became a repository for both, with guides for elements such as the administration screens, while Lorelle wrote a series of [WordPress Lessons](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-docs/2005-April/000480.html) to teach people how to make the most out of WordPress.	
	
After a flurry of activity on the wp-docs mailing list for its first few years, it started to die down, and some months saw [barely any posts at all](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-docs/2006-May/thread.html). The documentation continued to grow, and while there was lots of good documentation, a big problem with the Codex was its structure. [Martin Sturm posted to the wp-docs mailing list highlighting the problem](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-docs/2007-February/001436.html). Tutorials, how-tos and reference documentation were all mixed up together. The function reference was incomplete, and the plugin API only poorly documented. 	

Incremental changes have been made over the years. [PHPDocumentor was added in WordPress 2.7](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-docs/2008-October/001769.html), when there was a big push by Jacob Santos and Jennifer Hodgdon to get functions in WordPress documented in the code. There was also a push in WordPress 2.7 to [create an official user handbook](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-docs/2009-January/001862.html). In addition to the user handbook, [Jen Mylo posted to the wp-docs mailing list in August 2009](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-docs/2009-August/002034.html) about a series of handbooks for tackling different aspects of WordPress - theme development, plugin development, for example. A [Trac instance was set up](http://docs.trac.wordpress.org/), along with a [wordpress.com blog for managing the handbooks](http://wphandbook.wordpress.com/). These projects, however, didn’t get very far, and aborted handbook projects have started and stopped since 2009. In 2014, two projects are in progress to complete the theme and plugin developer handbooks.

There have also [been discussions about creating a WordPress developer portal](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2009-December/029264.html). An alpha version of developer.wordpress.org appeared in 2014. There was a drive in WordPress  3.7 to update all of the hook documentation, and the resulting code was used to create [an automated code reference](http://developer.wordpress.org/reference). 	

WordPress.org hasn’t just been a repository for documentation, it’s also been a repository for code. Both the theme and plugin directory have played important roles in the community. They have made it possible for developers and designers to easily share their code, as well as providing a central place for users to find that code. Over the years, both directories have been refined and made more useful for both groups.	

The first repository was the [WordPress Plugin Repository](http://wordpress.org/news/2005/01/the-wordpress-plugin-repository/). This was hosted at dev.wp-plugins.org, powered by Trac with version control using subversion. As well as having a code repository that users and developers could browse, the wiki was used for a very early version of the Plugin Directory.
	
<img src="../../Resources/community/plugin-directory-2005.jpg" width="800px" />

The repository, while being full of tools for developers, didn’t have an easy user interface that would help users to find the plugins that they need. Trac and wikis can often be difficult for non-technical software users to navigate. In March 2007, the Plugin Directory was launched. This gave exposure to developers using WordPress and made it easier for users to find plugins.	

<img src="../../Resources/community/plugin-directory-2007.jpg" width="800px" />

Prior to the plugin directory, lots of developers would just host their plugins on their website. The plugin directory gave them exposure to a huge amount of new users. Samuel Wood ([Otto42](http://profiles.wordpress.org/otto42), recalls how the plugin directory encouraged him to distribute his code. “I was writing them before, but I didn't give them to anybody. It encouraged me to release plugins because I had a place to put them.”	

In WordPress 2.7 the plugin repository was made available to WordPress users through the WordPress admin. They no longer had to download a plugin and upload it using FTP. A user could search the plugin directly for the features they needed right from their admin, and install the plugin with just a few clicks. This made it much easier for WordPress users to quickly find and install plugins, removing the barrier to entry that came with having to have knowledge of FTP.	

Themes lagged behind plugins in terms of an official repository. For a long time themes were hosted on themes.wordpress.org, an unofficial directory of themes. Theme developers could simply upload their theme and users could browse the directory for themes that they liked. 	

<img src="../../Resources/community/theme-viewer-2007.jpg" width="800px" />

However, the system was susceptible to spam and duplicate themes. Some theme developers tried to game the system by [downloading their theme multiple times](https://web.archive.org/web/20080415170633/http://themes.wordpress.net/blog/939/first-spammer-caught/) to appear at the top of the most popular results. And when the furore around sponsored themes erupted, the theme viewer was at the centre of the controversy.  	
When Matt took over the theme viewer, [he identified some of the site’s major problems](https://web.archive.org/web/20080404175227/http://themes.wordpress.net/blog/4421/version-30/#more-4421). Themes were riddled with security problems, many of them had obfuscated code. Also, the system was continually being gamed, there were duplicate themes, and many contained spam. The aim of the redesign was to create a system more like the plugins directory and repository on WordPress.org. In July 2008, [the Theme Directory was launched on WordPress.org](http://wordpress.org/news/2008/07/theme-directory/), using bbPress (which, at that time, was not a plugin). Theme developers were able to upload a theme which was then hosted on WordPress.org. In WordPress 2.8, it was possible for users to install themes from the WordPress admin.	

Since launch, both the theme and plugin directories have evolved in minor ways. There have been improvements to the plugin directory that have made it easier for plugin developers to provide support, and to have multiple authors for plugins. The theme directory has evolved too, although both still remain on an old version of bbPress. Today, both the theme and plugin repository are undergoing a rewrite, with the creation of a repository plugin that would be open source and available for the community. 	

With both the theme and plugin directory open for submissions, they both eventually needed a team to review the code coming in. The first to be set up was the WordPress Theme Review Team. This was in 2010, around a year after the theme directory had been launched. Joseph Scott posted on the news blog. He wrote: 	

> The theme directory has been chugging along for more than a year now. During that time we’ve tinkered with the review process and some of the management tools, but haven’t really opened it up as much as we’d like. It’s time to rip off the band-aid and take some action; to that end, we’re looking for community members to help with the process of reviewing themes for the directory.	

There was a [rush of people who signed up for the new mailing list](http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/theme-reviewers/2010-June/), and a [set of guidelines was drawn up](http://codex.wordpress.org/index.php?title=Theme_Review&oldid=91889). Not everyone was happy with the guidelines, however. There were complaints that they were too restrictive and that it took far too long for themes to be reviewed. For those who had been writing themes for years, they felt that some of the theme requirements should instead be recommendations. On the WP Tavern forums, Justin Tadlock outlined some of the problems, including the fact that the guidelines didn’t allow for themes with custom template hierarchies or custom image systems. Some people felt that the theme review team should restrict itself to looking for spam and other objectionable practices. 	

Developers were frustrated that themes were being rejected on the basis of minor issues. Otto wrote on the WP Tavern forum, “A rejection for such minor things should simply *never* happen. Tell the developer about it. Work with them, send them explanations why these are issues. But a summary rejection for nothing is just freakin' stupid.” Other developers simply decided to [remove their themes from the directory](http://quirm.net/2010/08/27/retiring-themes/).	

For those reviewing the themes, there were problems, particularly with manpower. The theme review queue was backed up with 100 themes in July 2010, and ten new themes are being added every day. Only 3-4 people were actively reviewing themes.	

Over time, some of the processes have been automated and tools have been created to help with the theme review process. One is the [theme check plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-check/) which tests the theme against all of the latest theme review standards.	

It wasn’t until much later that the plugin review team was set up. This was another gripe from theme developers, who felt that plugin developers should be subject to as rigorous review as theme developers. The question was asked both on [community blogs](http://wptavern.com/is-a-plugin-validation-team-a-pipe-dream) and on [wp-hackers](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2010-August/034146.html). The number of plugins in the repository was rapidly growing and some people had concerns about the quality of the code. For a long time, the only person processing plugins for the repository was Mark Riley.	

Eventually Otto started to review the plugins too, and later Mika Epstein, Pippin Williamson, and Boone Gorges were added to the team. It’s more difficult to create an automated review process for plugins than it is for themes. A theme is a specific grouping of template files with a defined structure. It has functions it needs to call, it needs to have a header, footer, and a sidebar. But a plugin can be anything at all so there’s no way to automate the review process. It is a lot of work. Yet the benefit of introducing this review process is that it has cleared out plugins with security holes, that were malicious or spam. A set of [guidelines has evolved](https://wordpress.org/plugins/about/guidelines/) that is intended to protect WordPress users. 	

Changes in communication have always had a huge impact on human beings; the past thirty years have seen this escalate on a huge scale. We’ve gone from missing telephone calls to carrying our phones in our pockets, from grinding dial-up to high-speed always-on internet. We are always connected to the internet, always just a touch away from communicating with one another. 	

As a mass-communication tool, the internet is a space that creates relationships between people in different places all over the word. The communication that takes place is formed by the tools we make use of; websites that broadcast their message, others that invite interaction through comments, immediate one-to-one interaction in chat rooms and through instant messaging, the asynchronous communication afforded by Skype. Communities are shaped and created by the apparently unloaded question - how shall we communicate with one another? Should it be a mailing list or a forum? A usenet message board or an IRC chat room? This decision, which seems innocuous, determines all of the social interactions that take place in that community.	

WordPress, like all open source communities, has tried its share of communication tools, sometimes adopting those used by other open source communities, sometimes creating its own. But, as the community has grown, it has outgrown some communication tools and grown into others. 	

One of the first means by which the developers communicated was using an IRC chat room. WordPress also has a number of IRC chat rooms on [freenode](https://freenode.net/), a network that facilitates discussion for FOSS communities. b2/Cafelog had a channel so it made sense for WordPress to have one too. The first of these was #wordpress.	

An IRC channel provides a place where people can instantaneously communicate with one another. It’s also possible to log an IRC channel so that a record of what happened can be posted online.	

In the early days of WordPress, many community members would spend all day hanging out in the IRC chat room. For some, it was the tone of the IRC chat room that got them more actively involved in the WordPress community. Owen Winkler recalls:	

> I had stumbled on IRC channels for other programs before, and you know, you ask a question and no one answers or they make fun of you. WordPress was never like that. When I started out, if you came to the channel and you asked a question, people answered the question. After you learned a bit, if you stuck around, you would answer the questions too.	

It was this camaraderie that caused many people in the community to stick around. They were all learning how to write code and make software, and they were doing it together. Over time, WordPress has spawned more IRC chat rooms. The #wordpress IRC chat room is used more as a tool for user support, though there is a small community of regulars that frequent it. The #wordpress-dev channel is the place where WordPress development takes place, including weekly meetings and development chats. There are also individual chat rooms for the teams that work on different areas of the project.	

The support forums are important communication channel for the project. Originally Matt set up the support forums using miniBB, a simple, fast piece of forum software. As the number of people on the support forums grew, the software was unable to handle the increased load. But then in 2004, while stuck in San Francisco over Christmas, he took what he’d learned from WordPress and applied it to forum software, writing bbPress. Now, bbPress is a plugin, but when it was originally coded it was a standalone piece of software with its own templating system. [Matt wrote in the launch post](http://ma.tt/2004/12/bbpress/) that it was intended to “bring some weblog and WordPress sensibilities to forum software.”	
				
Today, the WordPress forums are mostly used for providing support to users and developers, but back when they were first set up they were the primary mode through which the community communicated. The [first post on the forums](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/beta-test?replies=12) appeared before WordPress was even released, with a request to beta test the software. Those involved in the thread were the first to sign up for the forums, involved with the project at its very inception.	

The support forums were used to talk about everything related to WordPress: [the WordPress.org website](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/wordpressorg-feedback?replies=19), [bug reports](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/textile-breaks-when-editing-posts?replies=3), [troubleshooting](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/weird-message?replies=3), [request for design feedback](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/critisism-of-my-new-design?replies=4). It was also a place for people to [post their hacks](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/wiki-links-hack?replies=4) and later their plugins. 	

Developers, however wanted a mailing list. This was one of the most important communication tools in a FOSS project and WordPress lacked one. It took more than a year for WordPress’ developer infrastructure to be set up. The [FAQ on WordPress.org reflects the approach to development at the time](https://web.archive.org/web/20040402000122/http://wordpress.org/docs/faq/):	
> _I am a programmer/designer/hacker — can I help with the development of WP?_	
> Sure you can! Post your suggestions and requests for features in the forums. Design or alter some hacks to add functionality to the WP suite of tools. Got some cool ideas on an innovative design? By all means, build it and show it off! If you want to be directly involved in the daily development of WP, the best way is to show your competence by building clean hacks or patches that conform to the developer guidelines. Once you have some code out there, contact Matt and he’ll talk to you about getting you involved more directly with development.	

The support forum [failed to provide the proper infrastructure that developers were used to on FOSS projects](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/development-culture-at-wp?replies=21). [Ryan Boren, who had experience of Linux development, posted to that thread](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/development-culture-at-wp?replies=21#post-7523: 	

> Communities are built around development mailing lists. That's where the bazaar really takes place. A BB [bulletin board] isn't nearly as good for sending and reviewing patches, performing UI reviews, and so forth. The BB is a nice resource that has its purpose, but a mailing list is better suited to development traffic. I would much rather use my favorite email client with its editing, sorting, and filtering capabilities than any web BB. Plus, the mail comes to me, not me to it.	
> Right now, I send all of my patches directly to Matt. I hope he gets them. If there was a development mailer, I would send the patches there so all interested parties could give them a look and see what people are working on.	

Matt responded in the thread to say that there was a mailing list, but that it was a private one in which he, Mike, and the other original developers communicated on. At that time, he wasn’t prepared to create a public mailing list, preferring to direct all development discussion to the WordPress forums.	

That discussion thread also contains the seed of what would increasingly become a point of contention for some in the WordPress community - the division between non-technical community members and developers. A developer mailing list would segregate the community into different groups. “it's exactly the mentality that causes most OS projects to become these developer-heavy, 'in-the-know' kind of places that make them unpleasant (and unapproachable) for the average user,” [wrote Cena](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/development-culture-at-wp?replies=21#post-7536). 	

But with a growing developer base a mailing list was inevitable. Developer mailing lists are one of the primary communication tools for most FOSS projects. They provide a way for developers to communicate with each other, discussing features and changes, and are often participated in by more advanced users who either have questions about the product or who want to answer the questions of others. 	

WordPress’ first mailing list wasn’t the developer mailing list but the documentation mailing list, wp-docs, which was [set up in November 2003](https://web.archive.org/web/20090107221645/http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/docs/2003-November/000000.html). This mailing list was used for discussion of WordPress’ documentation and wiki. It was active for 6 months before the [hackers mailing list](http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/hackers/) was set up. This was later moved to [wp-hackers](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/). Development discussion moved from the support forums and on to the mailing list, leaving the forums as a place to provide support. 	

A mailing list provides a distributed way for developers to communicate with one another from their email inbox. It enables them to ask questions about development and discuss new features. The wp-hackers mailing list exploded with activity when it was set up, busy with heated discussions about issues such as [whether comment links should be nofollow](http://plugins.lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/hackers/2005-January/003617.html) to discourage spammers, [the best way to format the date](http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/hackers/2004-August/001335.html), [how to start translating WordPress](http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/hackers/2004-December/003462.html).	

Not everyone was happy, however. As predicted in the earlier thread, the mailing list further cemented the division between those who were providing support (whether in the form of answering support tickets or writing documentation) and those writing the code. In a thread posted to wp-docs and forwarded to wp-hackers, [Podz talks of how those who are writing the code aren’t prepared to help out](http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/hackers/2004-July/000962.html). 	

As WordPress grew in its user and developer base, more and more people were attracted to the project. Less productive discussion was happening on wp-hackers, and more of the decision making was happening elsewhere. For example, in February 2007 [Ryan integrated phpmailer with WordPress](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3862). A short discussion happened on WordPress Trac (WordPress’ bug tracking software) and the code was committed. It wasn’t until September that year that a [discussion about PHPMailer happened on wp-hackers](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2007-September/014497.html), a discussion that most of the lead developers absented themselves from.	

Often the discussion focused not so much on producing software but fell into [meta-discussion about the mailing list](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2007-September/015058.html) itself, about the [high signal to noise ratio](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2007-September/015173.html), and about how to [improve mailing list etiquette](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2007-October/015489.html. 	

Some developers took to their own blogs to outline their concerns with wp-hackers. [Andy Skelton wrote](http://andy.wordpress.com/2007/10/03/wp-hackers/):	

> There is just one thing I want to make clear about wp-hackers: a hacker is not someone who discusses or pays lip service or dissents or casts a vote or says what can or should be done. Hackers aren’t committee members. Hackers are more interested in proving what can be done than arguing about it.	

This highlighted one of the major problems with wp-hackers. There was too much discussion of code and not enough writing of code, too much opinion and not enough fact. The problem with mailing lists, is that over time they come to be dominated by comments from people who have time to comment. Those who don’t have time to comment are the people who you most want to hear from, but they’re usually too busy to keep up with a high-traffic mailing list. Mailing lists have the potential to be a time-suck, with a tendency to descend into long arguments driven by people with the time to contribute to such arguments, and drag those who don’t have time into flame wars.	

WordPress isn’t alone in this phenomena. A [2013 study of the Apache Lucene mailing list](http://sback.it/publications/msr2013.pdf) found that “although the declared intent of development mailing list communication is to discuss project internals and code changes/additions, only 35 percent of the email threads regard the implementation of code artifacts.” As well as discussing development, the mailing list often strayed into discussion of social norms and behaviour. Significantly, the study also found that project developers participate in less than 75 percent of the discussion and start only half of the discussions.

The study also found that developers prefer to communicate on the issue tracking software, a finding that is borne out in WordPress as developers took their discussion from the mailing list to WordPress trac. 	

The benefit of using WordPress Trac for discussion was that it focused discussion directly on a Trac ticket which was opened to report a bug, feature, or enhancement. That said, as wp-hackers mailing list members caught on to the fact that the important discussions were happening on trac, it became just as susceptible to intractable discussions.

One of the pitfalls of carrying out discussions in public spaces is bike shedding. In his book, [Producing Open Source Software](http://producingoss.com/), Karl Fogel reprints [an email from Poul-Henning Kamp](http://bikeshed.com/) to the FreeBSD mailing list with the title “A bike shed (any colour will do) on greener grass…” In the email Kamp gives an example from [Parkinson’s Law of triviality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law_of_triviality):	

> Parkinson shows how you can go in to the board of directors and get approval for building a multi-million or even billion dollar atomic power plant, but if you want to build a bike shed you will be tangled up in endless discussions.	

This is because the atomic plant is so vast that only very few people can grasp it, and the board of directors assume that somebody has the knowledge and has done the groundwork. In contrast, anyone can build a bike shed, so everyone will have an opinion on how it should be built, and, more specifically in open source discussions, what color it should be.	

There is a tendency for software mailing lists and forums, over time, to descend into bike shed discussions. As the technical difficulty of an issues goes down, the “[probability of meandering goes up](http://producingoss.com/en/producingoss.html#bikeshed).” If a discussion is highly technical it can be difficult for everyone to follow along, but there are other discussions in which everyone can have a say. 	
[From _Producing Open Source Software_](http://producingoss.com/en/producingoss.html#bikeshed)	

> consensus is hardest to achieve in technical questions that are simple to understand and easy to have an opinion about, and in "soft" topics such as organization, publicity, funding, etc. People can participate in those arguments forever, because there are no qualifications necessary for doing so, no clear ways to decide (even afterward) if a decision was right or wrong, and because simply outwaiting other discussants is sometimes a successful tactic.	

With the fast rate of growth of its community and its low barrier to entry, the WordPress project has been as susceptible to bike shed discussions as any other open source project. A [Google search for “bikeshed” on the wp-hackers mailing list](https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Flists.automattic.com%2Fpipermail%2Fwp-hackers%2F+bikeshed&oq=site%3A&aqs=chrome.2.69i57j69i58j69i59j69i65l3.2535j0j4&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=91&ie=UTF-8#q=site:http:%2F%2Flists.automattic.com%2Fpipermail%2Fwp-hackers%2F+bikeshed&safe=off) displays a number of discussions in which a respondent has cried “bike shed”, as does a [similar search on trac](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/search?q=bikeshed&noquickjump=1&changeset=on&ticket=on).	

Of course, one person’s bike shed is another person’s bête noire, and there are a number of instances in which matters that appeared trivial flared up into long community discussions.	

There is an example from 2007, when discussion about what to call Links got heated. A [poster to wp-hackers asked](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2007-June/013299.html) “Anyone know why it's still called Blogroll in admin, when it's called Bookmarks in functions (wp_list_bookmarks) and yet displays by default as a list of "Links" in the sidebar?” The original post, entitled Blogroll, Bookmarks, Links, generated a total of 79 emails, and discussion spilled over from the mailing list and [on to a Trac ticket](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3695).

Trac has been the site of a recurrent bike shed discussion, around the issue of smilies. In 2009, [a ticket was opened up to replace](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/10145) WordPress’ smilies with Tango/Gnome smilies. The patch was [committed by Ryan Boren](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/11685)	

<img src="../../Resources/community/smilies.jpg" width="800px" />

The first place that the smilies landed was WordPress.com, which receives daily updates to the codebase. The [feedback wasn’t good](http://en.forums.wordpress.com/topic/new-smilies?replies=84), and reaction on the Trac ticket spiralled, with contributors unhappy that the changes to the smilies had been added to core without any discussion. The problem was that WordPress [changed users’ content](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/10145#comment:18), without giving them any say in it. Some users would be unhappy if, upon updating their website, their content was changed. The discussion moved from Trac tickets and spread out onto [community blogs](http://wptavern.com/nothing-to-smile-about), with calls, as is often the case with bike shed discussions, for a public poll.

Ryan Boren eventually [reverted the change](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/10145#comment:28) with the comment: “Back to the prehistoric smilies that everyone complains about but evidently likes better. :-) I was a fool for not appreciating the explosive topic that is smilies, my bad.”	

The smiley debate was reignited in 2014, when WordPress.com updated its emoticons and a proposal was made to [produce high-dpi smilies for use on retina displays](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24970). Yet again, the arguments were brought out, and [spread once again to community blogs ](http://wptavern.com/wordpress-smiley-wars-will-core-adopt-new-emoticons). As of May 2014, the smilies have still not been updated.	

Providing a fertile ground for bikeshed discussions isn’t the only problem with WordPress’ Trac system. Once of the recurrent problems with Trac has been that people open tickets, even add patches, [only for them to languish without feedback or discussion](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2010-February/030224.html). This is solved at various points when people take on the task of bug gardening but those people often end up getting more and more involved with development and have less time to spend bug gardening. In a thread on wp-hackers, Chris Jean outlined the problem:

> Adding keywords is a mysterious thing with no clear rules or  expectations on how they should be used. I've always felt that at most as the provider of the patch, I should provide has-patch. This is due to  the fact that I have no idea what a core dev considers worthy of  additional keywords. The description for commit specifies a "trusted  member". Who is a trusted member? Do I count as one yet? I have no idea.  To me, the has-patch keyword denotes that I, or the person who submitted the patch, has tested the patch against the build cited inside the diff and believes that the patch should be added to core. If the patch  submitter did not believe this, why would they submit the patch?  Apparently I'm wrong on this thinking, so being clearer in the docs could easily produce tickets more in line with what the core devs desire.	

While more committers have been added, getting patches committed to core and clearing up Trac tickets [continues to be a problem to this day](http://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/06/07/community-priorities/).

Attempts are regularly made to improve communication in the project. By 2009, central communication in the project had fragmented into a number of different places: Trac, wp-hackers, the #wordpress-dev IRC chat room, [wpdevel.wordpress.com](http://make.wordpress.org/core/page/121/) that was set up in 2008 and used for development updates, and the development blog on WordPress.org. A [post written by Jen Mylo in 2009](https://wordpress.org/news/2009/05/ideas/) highlights the state of each of WordPress’ primary communication channels: the #wordpress-dev channel had become mostly inactive, wp-hackers had thousands of subscribers but it often became a forum for troubleshooting, the [development blog](http://wordpress.org/news/) was largely a place for official announcements, the [wpdevel.wordpress.com](http://make.wordpress.org/core/) blog (directed now to http://make.wordpress.org/core) was a place for the core team to post what they were working on, Trac had become an an unworkable mess with hundreds of tickets lined up for future versions that weren’t even relevant anymore, and the ideas forum where anyone could suggest a new feature, but that had highly-voted but irrelevant threads featured highly.

A [thread was opened up to discuss improvements to communication](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/ideas-forumcommunication-channels?replies=55). There were a number of suggestions for improvements:
- Create somewhere for people to raise things other than Trac
- Find a way for make it easier for people to write automated unit tests
- Make it possible for the community to vote on ideas
- Better integrate documentation into WordPress and Trac
- P2 be used for discussion
- BuddyPress (a social-networking plugin that is a sister-project to WordPress) be used on WordPress.org

But in addition to suggestions, there were a number of complaints: that no one official reads the ideas forum, IRC meet ups were difficult for people to attend because of timezone differences, that there were too many channels of communication - far too much for people to keep up with. 	

There were also complaints about the governance of the community. Some felt that there was no transparency about how things were run. As [Jen responded](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/ideas-forumcommunication-channels/page/2?replies=55#post-1071517), “Your post just proves the point that communication is an issue. I would not say that WP lacks a clear direction, I would say that it simply hasn't been communicated properly.”	

Part of the intention for the post, and for a lot of work that Jen was doing at the time, was to make it clear how decisions were made in project. It wasn’t uncommon for people to come into the IRC chat and throw in feature requests, and it was more helpful if people knew the correct channels for asking questions and requesting features.	

There were attempts to fix some of the problems with the different communication channels. Justin Shreve worked on a [GSoC project to create a theme specifically for the ideas forum](http://justin.wordpress.com/2010/04/01/gsoc-proposal-specialized-theme-for-ideas-feedback/). This would have improved comments, ideas statuses, a reporting system, and Trac integration. Once an idea reached a significant amount of feedback, solutions, comments, or popularity, a Trac ticket would be created with a link back to the idea. Justin passed GSoC, but a satisfactory interface was never created for WordPress.org so it was never implemented.

The WordPress community hasn’t only been defined by the central communication tools through which it operates. Just as significant are the blogs run by the many members of its community. WordPress is, after all, blogging software, and the people who joined the community often started out as bloggers themselves. Those that didn’t blog already often [set one up after becoming involved](http://nacin.com/2010/02/24/hello-world/), to [eat their own dog food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_one%27s_own_dog_food), as the saying in product and software development often goes.	

Not long after WordPress was launched, blogs starting cropping up dedicated to to the platform. The first of these was WeblogToolsCollection (WLTC), a blog initially launched by Mark Ghosh to cover every type of weblog tool but that quickly became focused almost solely on WordPress. It was followed by Carthik Sharma’s [Wordlog](http://wordlog.com) and Lorelle van Fossen’s [Lorelle on WordPress](http://lorelle.wordpress.com). As the community grew, more and more of these blogs sprang up. Some focused on tutorials, sharing guides on how to do things with WordPress, others created lists of plugins and themes that would draw large amounts of traffic.	

These sites provided places for people to congregate outside of the official channels. WP-Hackers was dominated by developers and could be a daunting place for those not already in the developer circle, the support forums were for support, and Trac was for development. The comments sections of WordPress community blogs often have comment threads running into the hundreds, particularly in the heyday of discussions about trademarks, GPL, and all of the other issues that caused feelings to run high. As WordPress’ user base grew, so did the number of community blogs. For a number of years the community gathered at WP Candy, run by Ryan Imel. WPMU.org provided a place for tutorials and the occasional controversy. A site of regular debates was WP Tavern, run by Jeff Chandler, who had formerly written at WLTC. 	

As well as being a community blog, WP Tavern ran parallel forums where the community could discuss current issues. It was here that some of the community’s most heated debates happened. 	
The most heated of all was a big community argument around the issue of the data that WordPress collects from websites and sends back to WordPress.org, often described as “phoning home”. 	

This was an issue going back as far as WordPress 2.3, when the plugin update notification system was added. This notified users when a new version of WordPress or of a plugin was available for install. Code was added for a [WordPress update notification](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/1476) that collected data from a user’s site and sent it back to http://api.wordpress.org. The data collected was the WordPress version, PHP version, locale setting, and the website’s URL. A [further piece of code](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/5913) carried a [plugin update check](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/4795), which sent the website’s URL, WordPress version, and plugin info (including inactive plugins) to api.wordpress.org.	

Some were unhappy that WordPress was collecting data and storing it on WordPress.org. They thought that [collecting the blog URL was unnecessary](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2007-September/014860.html), others had no problem with WordPress collecting the data, but were [unhappy that WordPress was not disclosing it](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2007-September/014919.html). A ticket was opened on WordPress Trac to [request that update checking be anonymised](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5066). A number of people who didn’t oppose the changes still felt that there should be an opt-out option so that users who required complete privacy would be able to turn off the data collection.

Despite the extensive discussion on wp-hackers, [WordPress 2.3 was launched as planned](http://wordpress.org/news/2007/09/wordpress-23/), with the following note in the announcement post:	
	> Our new update notification lets you know when there is a new release of WordPress or when any of the plugins you use has an update available. It works by sending your blog URL, plugins, and version information to our new api.wordpress.org service which then compares it to the plugin database and tells you whats the latest and greatest you can use.	

Matt also posted a [first version of a privacy policy on WordPress.org](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2007-September/015014.html).	

Despite community members being somewhat mollified, it wasn’t the end of the 2007 phoning home outrage. As WordPress 2.3 was released, [a post appeared on Slashdot with the following](http://yro.slashdot.org/story/07/09/25/1632246/wordpress-23-does-not-spy-on-users-updated):	
> "Popular open-source blogging engine WordPress has been upgraded to 2.3 — with some unexpected nasties in the mix. As of version 2.3, WordPress now periodically (every 12 hours) sends personally identifying information (blog name & URI) to the mothership, along with an alarming amount of information including $_SERVER dumps, a list of installed plugins, and your current PHP/MySQL settings. Most unfortunately, it does not provide any way of disabling this functionality, and WordPress does not have any privacy policy protecting this information. In a thread about the issue, lead developer Matt Mullenweg defends his actions and staunchly refuses to add an opt-in interface, telling users to 'fork WordPress' if they aren't willing to put up with this behavior."	

Matt came in for considerable fire for suggesting that people who didn’t like it use different software, fork WordPress, or use a plugin the opt-out. The post also [made ripples in other open source communities](http://grokbase.com/t/drupal/development/079s01v924/wordpress-2-3-spies-on-users). The community came to Matt’s defence, with some of those who [were critics of how the incident was handled](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2007-September/014904.html) defending [him the most](http://yro.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=307899&cid=20745559). At Matt’s request, the original author changed the title to “WordPress 2.3 Does Not Spy on Users.”	

The issue was re-opened in 2009 on the WP Tavern forums by Lynne Pope, [who also posted to wp-hackers](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2009-December/029083.htm). Lynne pointed out that Matt had said that the situation with regards to data collection would be reviewed in WordPress 2.5, and asked whether WordPress had found a need to collect blog URLs. In the discussion thread on WP Tavern, Lynne went further into her concerns: [link?}	

>  wordpress.org is not a legal entity so there is nobody to sue if data is misused. You can't sue a community. There is no disclosure about what data is collected or how it will be used. People are just supposed to trust that volunteers working on an open source project can be relied upon to keep personal data private?	

She also made [reference to WordPress.org being cracked in March 2007](http://wordpress.org/news/2007/03/upgrade-212/), making the point that if someone were to again crack WordPress.org they would have access to all of that data.	

Since much of the data was freely available on the internet already, many people were unconcerned about the collection, but Lynne made the point that what isn’t available easily is the totality of that information.	

Opponents felt that it was unnecessary for WordPress to collect the blog URL information, as it isn’t necessary to carry out update checks.	

Mark Jaquith, who had originally opposed the data collection, [responded to Lynne on wp-hackers](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2009-December/029089.html):	
> The more I thought about it, the more my knee-jerk objections faded away. Your server is doing an HTTP request, so the server knows your server's IP address. You can figure out what blog domains are hosted	on that IP with a search on Bing or several other search engines. So if WordPress.org really wanted to know your URL, it could find it. Again, that's just based on the IP address, which you HAVE to send for HTTP to work. If your URL is discoverable, and your IP address has to be sent, withholding the URL doesn't actually get you more privacy, ultimately.	

Much of the discussion about phoning home took place away from wp-hackers, with the bulk of it taking place on the WP Tavern blog and forums The phoning home  thread generated 291 responses and was the most popular post on the forum. It was also [heavily discussed on WeblogToolsCollection](http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2009/12/10/is-wordpress-spyware/) under a post from Jeff Chandler titled “Is WordPress spyware?”	

The issue on [WordPress Trac was reopened for discussion](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5066#comment:23), and [was mooted for the development chat](http://make.wordpress.org/core/2009/12/10/suggest-agenda-items-for-dec-17th-dev-ch/#comment-1030) - some community members felt that their concerns around privacy were valid and felt that [Matt failed to be taking them seriously](http://make.wordpress.org/core/2009/12/10/suggest-agenda-items-for-dec-17th-dev-ch/#comment-1042). He did, however, clarify in the thread that WordPress.org only stored the latest update sent but no historical data. Historical data was only held in aggregate so that statistics could be provided for plugin and theme developers.

Mark Jaquith, who had originally opposed the data collection, joined in the discussion on WP Tavern to say why he had changed his mind when it came to objecting to data collection:	
- an IP address, which must be sent by the server, is not significantly more anonymous than a URL	
- URLs allow WordPress to verify the identity of a blog. When URLs are hashed it’s no longer possibly to verify the blog identity leaving systems that involve plugin rankings based on usage or popularity to be gamed.	
- the privacy policy was updated to cover api.wordpress.org	

The lead developers are also opposed to adding new options to enable people to opt-in or opt-out of the data collection. “decisions, not options,” is a cornerstone of the WordPress ethos. As lead developer Peter Westwood said in the 2007 discussion around data collection:	

> One of the core design ideas for WordPress is that we don't introduce options lightly. The moment you think of making a feature optional you challenge the argument for introducing the feature in the beginning.	

WordPress continues to collect data about sites. The data is used in a number of ways. It affects decision making. The project can make informed decisions about what technologies to support. The data was crucial in the decision to [drop support for PHP 4.0 and MySQL 4.0](http://wordpress.org/news/2010/07/eol-for-php4-and-mysql4/). Using the data collected, they were able to tell that, in 2010, around 11 percent of WordPress users were using a PHP version below 5.2, and that fewer than 6 percent of WordPress users were using MySQL 4.0.

More recently, it’s used as part of the automatic updating system that appeared in WordPress 3.7, when WordPress started to update blogs automatically for point releases. With the data available, WordPress can personalise automatic updates to ensure that the site is upgraded correctly. WordPress’ terms of service dictates what can and cannot be done with data - it’s never publicly dealt with or sold.	

In addition to community blogs, a lot of the community’s interaction happens on personal blogs. Ian Stewart’s ThemeShaper, for example, was the locus for much of the debate around the GPL and Themes. A debate that was thrashed out in the comment thread of a personal blog was the discussion around the capital_P_dangit() function. Theme developer, Justin Tadlock [wrote about it on his blog and the post generated 139 comments](http://justintadlock.com/archives/2010/07/08/lowercase-p-dangit). 	

This issue, much like the discussion around smilies, was centred around WordPress changing a user’s content. The function was written by Matt in 2010 and [committed by Andrew Nacin](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/14996). The function is a basic filter that replaces spellings of Wordpress with WordPress, ensuring that WordPress retains its CamelCase. 	

People felt that WordPress was messing with their content, and that transforming Wordpress into WordPress was the start of a slippery slope. For some, it was a form of overbearing pedantry, for others it constituted censorship. After all, if someone wanted to write Wordpress instead of WordPress, why shouldn’t they? The principle of the matter was that WordPress had no business changing what people wanted to write. People who were unhappy with the change, saw this as incommensurable with the core freedoms of the project - [openness, freedom, and community](http://justintadlock.com/archives/2010/07/08/lowercase-p-dangit).	

A further issue was that, in order for a community member to have a patch in core, they would have to open a Trac ticket, wait for discussion and feedback, and have the code reviewed prior to the patch being committed. When core developers could just circumvent this process, it upset members of the community.

Not all core developers were happy with the change. [Andy Skelton posted to the mailing list to say](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2010-July/033007.html) “I know Matt well enough to predict the reasons for his intentions and to know that they are good and unselfish, even while opinionated and objectionable.” In the same email, he also reiterates his unhappiness with the thread.	

A further problem was that in some instances the filter was breaking URLS. This was [reported prior to WordPress 3.0’s release](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/13583), but because the filter had already worked well on WordPress.com, it wasn’t fixed. For example, [a user reported on trac](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/13971) that his image, named “WordpressLogo_blue-m.png” was broken because it had been renamed to “WordPressLogo_blue-m.png”. Upon upgrading to WordPress 3.0, other users, those with folders named Wordpress, [experienced the same problem](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/images-not-appearing-3?replies=30#post-1559585). As well as folders, URLs with the spelling Wordpress were broken. Hosts saw an uptick in support request. "When 3.0 arrived,” says Mike Schroder, of Dreamhost, “we had a deluge of support with broken URLs due to capital_P_dangit() applying to all content.  This was a particular problem because it was popular among customers to use '/wordpress' as a subdirectory for their install. We helped customers with temporary workarounds in the meantime, but were very happy to see the issue fixed in 3.0.1." Mark Jaquith [added a fix](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/13971#comment:15), but for many contributors it should never had got to the point at which the WordPress software was breaking users’ websites.	

The capital_P_dangit function isn’t the only function in WordPress to filter content. Other filters include emoticons, autop, shortcodes, texturize, special characters, curly quotes, tag balancing, filtered HTML / kses, and comment link nofollows.	
The argument was that changing Wordpress to WordPress didn’t actually change the meaning of the sentence, except in edge cases such as the sentence “Wordpress is the incorrect capitalisation of WordPress.”	

Some felt that the discussion was becoming an unnecessary [attack on Matt](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2010-July/032969.html). And the [core developers became frustrated](http://justintadlock.com/archives/2010/07/08/lowercase-p-dangit#comment-211354) by the hyperbole around the inclusion of the filter and by the amount of words spent arguing about it. In a comment in a post on Justin Tadlock’s blog, Mark Jaquith left the following comment:	

> Calling corrections* censorship is absurd. It is no less absurd when the capitalization of a single letter is called censorship. There is actual censorship going on all around the world at this very moment. I’m damn proud of the fact that WordPress is being used to publish content that makes governments around the world afraid of the citizens who publish it. I’m incredulous that people are making a fuss about a single character (which is only one of dozens of automatic corrections that WordPress makes). It’s free software that is easily extended (or crippled) by plugins. If the thought of going the rest of your life without misspelling WordPress it too much to bear, you have an easy out. Take it, take a deep breath, and try to pick your battles.”	
[A website that Mark put together](http://capitalp.org/), reflects the position of many of the core developers about the capital_P_dangit discussion.	

<img src="../../Resources/community/capital_p_dangit.png.jpg" width="800px" />

While this had all of the [hallmarks of a bikeshed](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2010-July/032919.html), there were some procedural issues that community members felt ought to be taken seriously. Whether the WordPress software capitalised the P in WordPress or not, the method with which they were added to core broke accepted procedure - no ticket was opened, no patch was uploaded to trac, the code was simply committed. For some this set up an us and them mentality whereby some core developers could commit code as they felt, whereas everyone else in the community was subject to a different process.	

One of the most significant changes to WordPress’ communication channels has been make.WordPress.org. This is a network of blogs hosted on WordPress.org: each blog is a communication channel for the different teams on the project - core, documentation, polyglots, for example. Prior to having make.WordPress.org, much of the communication was scattered over different mailing lists and IRC chat rooms. 	

Each of the blogs on make.WordPress.org runs a P2 blog - this theme, created by Automattic for internal communication, is a microblogging tool that lets users post on the front end and then the post is followed by threaded comments where people can discuss the initial post. Unless made completely open, only people who are editors of a blog can make a post while anyone is able to comment.	

This created an important centralised space on WordPress.org where people can gather. If a contributor is interested in core development they can follow the core blog, forum moderators can follow the support blog, people with a UI focus can follow the UI blog. Contributors can subscribe to the blogs and follow along with what’s going on from their email inboxes. While mailing lists are publicly archived, they often give the feeling of privacy because the contributor emails from their inbox and the mailing list archives are often difficult to find. By moving everything onto P2 blogs on make.WordPress.org the tone of the conversation was changed - everything took place in a very public place. While it didn’t always work, this encouraged a more respectful attitude amongst community members, with a focus on getting work done rather than descending into arguments.	

Over time, WordPress’ communication channels have adapted to the needs of WordPress users and developers. WP-hackers is less active than it used to be as core development takes place on make.wordpress.org. General chit-chat has moved away from IRC and often takes place on social media such as Twitter, or in Skype chatrooms set up as general water coolers. Resources like [WordPress Stack Exchange](https://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/1500/wordpress-development) have provided a new home for developers with technical questions, while users still rely on the support forums for help with their sites.	

The other huge change to the community’s communication channels has been the rise of WordCamps. WordCamps are WordPress-focused conferences that take place all over the world. They’re a place for WordPress users, contributors, developers, business-owners, and enthusiasts come together to listen to presentations, to meet, and to learn about WordPress.	

The first WordCamp happened in August 2006 at the Swedish American House in San Francisco. It was set up by Matt, as a “barcamp-style” conference: “"BarCamp-style" is a code phrase for "last minute.”” [he wrote on his blog](http://ma.tt/2006/07/wordcamp/). He announced the WordCamp on 9th July, with August 5th as the date, and no venue settled. They did, however, manage to pull it together, and despite some snafus with the sign-up process, the event went well. At that very first WordCamp San Francisco some WCSF traditions were started: most notably Matt’s annual State of the Word presentation, and barbecue for lunch. The following year, they did it all over again, and September 2007 saw the first WordCamp outside of San Francisco - WordCamp Beijing.	

This started a trend of WordPress users and community members getting together all over the world. The number of WordCamps has grown exponentially, and every year new WordCamps are set up in diverse countries Japan, Brazil, Kenya, India, the Netherlands, and Russia.	

WordCamps haven’t been without their problems. In the beginning, interested people would just decide to organise a WordCamp. They would contact Maya, who was doing admin at Automattic at the time, who would send out stickers, buttons and other swag. In 2009, [WordPress.com blog was set up for WordCamp organisers](http://wordcamphowto.wordpress.com/2009/06/26/hello-welcome-to-this-super-blog/) to communicate with one another. Since WordCamps were so informal, there was no ensuring that they were running properly. Many WordCamps ran without budgets, despite being events that had a lot of money running through them. There were situations in which organisers would take some of the money for themselves. Another WordCamp was launched, with registration, just so that the organiser could compile a mailing list to which they could send marketing emails. A WordCamp was set up, they took sponsorship money, and then never ran the WordCamp and never gave back the sponsorship money. [confirming these with AM]	

It was clear that WordCamps needed to be better monitored, with guidelines and someone to oversee them. The first person to [take this on was Jen Mylo](http://wordcamphowto.wordpress.com/2010/05/19/fyi-im-taking-over-as-central-liaison/). In her announcement post, she makes reference to the fact that WordCamps bear the official seal of approval of WordPress, and, as such, they should only promote WordPress products that are GPL-compliant. This meant no one could speak, organise or volunteer at a WordCamp if they sold or promoted a WordPress product that wasn’t 100 percent GPL.

In some quarters, [the changes went down badly](http://onefinejay.com/2010/05/19/a-few-questions-on-jane-wells-revised-wordcamp-policies). Others [took a calmer look at it](http://www.bloggingpro.com/archives/2010/05/19/wordcamps-need-to-be-gpl-too-now/) but they, too, asked why people who promoted non-GPL products would be banned from speaking. This all happened shortly before things came to a head with Thesis and Chris Pearson. While many of the WordPress theme shops were 100 percent GPL, some hadn’t followed suit and were indignant that they would have to do so just to speak at a WordCamp.

Jen published [the first version of the WordCamp guidelines](https://web.archive.org/web/20100723003529/http://central.wordcamp.org/about/). They were that WordCamps should:	
- be about WordPress 
- be open to all, easy to access, shared with the community 
- locally organised and focused 
- volunteer-driven 
- stand alone events 
- promoting WordPress’ philosophy 
- not be about making money	

The [guidelines have been refined over the years](http://plan.wordcamp.org/become-an-organizer/representing-wordpress/), particularly in relation to community feedback. While not everyone remains happy about them, they have not prevented WordCamps from flourishing across the world.	

As well as being events that allow WordPress users to learn about WordPress, they are places where the contributor community comes together. 2013 onwards saw an increase in WordCamps holding contributor days. A contributor day is an event, usually attached to a WordCamp (but not always) at which people can learn how to get involved with the project. For some people, this is their first taste of contributing. For others it’s a way to get together to work through tickets or discuss new features. While the WordPress community is used to working together online, meeting face-to-face has added another dimension to relationships.	

From its small beginnings in the b2/cafelog chat room, the WordPress community has become a thriving place with members from diverse backgrounds, from all over the world. The number of WordCamps increase every year, as does the number of contributors. There are events focused purely on business, or education, or government. It's also a FOSS community that it's possible to get involved with whatever your background. Writers can write documentation or blog about the platform, designers can help with the user interface or the default themes. Teachers can teach WordPress and create courses to be shared with others. People can organise events, big and small.

The future, however, isn't straightforward. WordPress a PHP-focused community but JavaScript developers are needed as the platform implements more and more JavaScript in the interface. The community needs to attract developers with expertise in mobile development, to ensure that WordPress continues to be a relevant platform on every device, both in native applications and in the browser application. Attracting new contributors from different backgrounds is going to be a huge factor in how it meets these challenges to help the platform flourish over the next ten years.
