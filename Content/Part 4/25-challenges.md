## 25. Creating a Folksonomy

In the wake of the exodus to Habari, the project was changing even more. In March 2007, Robin Adrianse ([rob1n](https://profiles.wordpress.org/rob1n)), WordPress’ first temporary committer, was given commit access for three months to help Ryan Boren address the issue of languishing trac tickets. 

Also in March, the Plugin Directory was launched. Prior to the Plugin Directory, many developers just hosted their plugins on their website. The plugin directory gave them exposure to a huge number of WordPress users. Samuel Wood ([Otto42](http://profiles.wordpress.org/otto42), recalls how the plugin directory encouraged him to distribute his code. “I was writing them before, but I didn't give them to anybody. It encouraged me to release plugins because I had a place to put them.”

2.1 was eventually launched in January 2007, after a release cycle of more than a year. The following cycle was the first to adopt the new 120 day release cycle. This new goal, which would later become “deadlines are not arbitrary” in WordPress’ list of philosophies, was an ongoing challenge and it was tested even in WordPress 2.2. Developing in an open source environment means leaving time for every voice to be heard, waiting for volunteers with busy lives to get things done, spending time in discussions about new features and architecture changes. It’s a challenge that WordPress would have to address release cycle after release cycle.

And in the 2.2 release cycle, the first cycle with the new 120 day model, this approach would be put to the test in a major way. WordPress 2.2 was the release with some of the biggest database architecture changes to date - a new taxonomy system.

In the early 2000s, the internet was rife with discussions about the best way to organise information. Content has metadata assigned to it, that can be used to organise and display data. Traditional modes of classification on the web used top-down methods which imposed a top-down method of categorization. A website created a category structure and users of that website placed user-generated content in the correct category. These structures were often rigid, forcing users to shoehorn their content into something that didn’t necessarily fit. A new method of classification emerged - tags, a bottom-up of form of classification, in which an index, or a cloud, can be generated based on keywords that the content creator themselves applies to the content.	

The first system to use tags was social bookmarking site [Del.icio.us](https://delicious.com/). While Del.icio.us wasn’t pioneering as a bookmarks manager, it differentiated itself with its tagging system. Users can tag saved links, which are used to relate links to each other, both in a user’s own collection and across the entire social network. Visiting the link http://delicious.com/tag/php will display all of the links that have been tagged PHP.	

Controlled, top-down, ways of classifying content failed to scale on large-scale Web 2.0 applications in which millions of users created and organized their content. Users couldn’t be forced to use controlled vocabularies. [Clay Shirky discussed the problem](http://many.corante.com/archives/2005/01/07/folksonomies_controlled_vocabularies.php):

> users pollute controlled vocabularies, either because they misapply the words, or stretch them to uses the designers never imagined, or because the designers say “Oh, let’s throw in an ‘Other’ category, as a fail-safe” which then balloons so far out of control that most of what gets filed gets filed in the junk drawer. Usenet blew up in exactly this fashion, where the 7 top-level controlled categories were extended to include an 8th, the ‘alt.’ hierarchy, which exploded and came to dwarf the entire, sanctioned corpus of groups.	
The system of classification using mass tagging systems became known as a [folksonomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folksonomy). This is a classification system in which users classifying content themselves. 	
In 2005, Technorati, the blog search engine, [launched its own tagging system](http://www.sifry.com/alerts/archives/000270.html). This created a tag search across major platforms such as Blogger and Typepad, CMS like Drupal, and other services such as Flickr, Delicious and Socialtext. 	

WordPress lagged behind, and there was pressure from both the free software and WordPress.com communities to add tags to the platform. WordPress’ native form of classification is hierarchical, top-down categories. A website owner can use it to create their navigational structure, for example. To interact with WordPress, [Technorati picked up the “tag” from the WordPress post’s category](http://lorelle.wordpress.com/2005/09/11/adding-technorati-tags-to-wordpressmu-sites/#comment-113). This was unsatisfactory to lots of users as categories and tags are two different types of classification.

On his blog, [Carthik Sharma wrote](http://carthik.net/blog/vault/2006/02/21/tags-are-not-categories/):	
> categories can be tags but tags cannot be categories. Categories are like the huge signs you see on aisles in supermarkets – “Food”, “Hygiene”, “Frozen” etc, they guide you to sections where you can find what you are looking for. Tags are like the labels on the products themselves.	

Categories and tags have two distinct use-cases. Categories are more rigid, whereas tags are a lightweight way of classifying content. There was, of course, a plugin that did the job: WordPress users installed the [Ultimate Tag Warrior](http://neato.co.nz/ultimate-tag-warrior/) plugin (though WordPress.com users could not).	
In 2007, a ticket was [opened by Ryan Boren to add tagging support to WordPress](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3723). It was finally agreed that WordPress would have tags. The next step was decide on the database schema.

All of a WordPress user’s content and data is stored in the database, which is made up of different tables from which the data is retrieved. There is a post table, for example, which stores all of the data relating to posts. And a user table, which stores all of the data about users. Making changes to the database is not trivial. Any changes have to be done correctly because undoing them in the future can be difficult. Changes need to be performant. In a PHP/MySQL setup, increasing the number of database queries can slow the site down. The question arose: in which table should tagging data be stored? Should they be in a new table? Or should they be stored in one of the already existing tables?
	
Ryan proposed two database schemas. One of these [created a new table for tags](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/3723/tagging.diff), the second put [tags in categories database table](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/3723/tags.diff).  Matt was keen on the second proposal - putting tags in the categories table. He felt that it didn’t make sense to create another table exactly the same as the categories table. In a [comment on trac he wrote](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3723#comment:16):

> We already have a ton of rewrite, API, etc infrastructure around categories. Mostly I see tagging as a new interface to the data. On the display side, people want their tags listed separately from their categories, and probably something like a tag cloud function.	

WordPress had already successfully reused tables in the past; for example, posts, pages, and attachments are all stored in the same table, and at that time the categories table also contained link categories. The addition of tagging, from a user’s perspective, enabled them to tag posts, display a list of tags, and display posts with the same tag. What was the point in duplicating the infrastructure when it could be achieved within the current table system?	

The proposal to put tags in the same table as categories [was not supported by many other developers](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2007-April/011730.html). This is because categories and tags are two different ways of organising data. The reasons put forward for not re-using the category table were that the category table would become bloated and that putting tags in the category table meant including additional code to keep the two taxonomy types separate. This additional code could introduce bugs, make it harder to maintain in the future, and make it difficult for developers to extend.	

April 2007 on wp-hackers](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2007-April/thread.html) was spent discussing the new database schema for taxonomies. A suggestion that got considerable traction from the community was that categories, link categories, and tags, all be split up into their own individual tables, but no one could come to a consensus. 

After checking in the single-table taxonomy structure (changesets [#5110](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/5110) and [#5111](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/5111)), Matt posted a new thread on wp-hackers [stating the case for using the categories table](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2007-April/011930.html). He argued that: 

1. it would perform faster as no additional queries would need to be carried out to support tags. A separate tag table would require at least 2 extra queries on the front end. 
2. that it would provide a better long-term foundation. Tags and categories would be able to share terms (for example the category “dogs” and the tag “dogs”). 
3. That there were no user-facing or plugin-facing problems.	

In the thread, he also proposed a new table, inspired by Drupal’s taxonomy system, specifically for terms within a specific taxonomy. Terms are the items within a category or tag, or other taxonomy; dog, cat, and chicken are all terms within an “animal” taxonomy. This additional table allowed terms to be shared amongst taxonomies while having the same ID (the ID is what identifies an item in the database). Just one term, “dog” for example, would be saved in the database, and this term could be used in any taxonomy. Ryan Boren [proposed a new solution](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2007-April/011991.html), one which enabled individual terms to be part of any taxonomies while keeping the same ID.	
The schema was a compromise. It was a three-table solution, with a table for terms, taxonomies, and objects. Discussion went back and forth, a [new trac ticket was opened up](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/4189) and a new structure was created based on this original proposal. The first table wp_terms, holds basic information about single terms. The wp_term_taxonomy places the term in a taxonomy. The final table, term_relationships relates objects (such as posts or links) to a term_taxonomy_id from the term_taxonomy table.

 This approach has the advantage of assigning one ID to a term name while using another table to relate that to a specific taxonomy. It is extensible for plugin developers, who can create their own taxonomies. It also enables large multisite networks, such as WordPress.com, to create global taxonomies - unified tagging systems in which users of different blogs can share terms within a taxonomy.

As with many WordPress features, tags landed on WordPress.com before it was shipped with WordPress. From the beginning, the new structure caused huge technical problems. The increase in tables meant that WordPres.com needed more servers to deal with the additional queries. “It was slower to be completely honest,” says Matt, “that was a cost that we saw in a very real way on WordPress.com, but also a hidden cost that we did impose on everyone who was doing WordPress in the world.”	
	As well as being a challenging code problem, the activity around the implementation of taxonomies highlighted problems in the development process. All of the back and forth discussion meant that development was dragging on. Some proposed that the release be delayed, others that the feature be pulled, others still that the current schema be shipped with a view to revising it in the next version. Andy Skelton [responded to the wp-hackers discussion](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2007-April/011988.html):

> To include a premature feature in an on-time release degrades the quality of the product. I refer to not only the code but the state of the community. Increments are supposed to be in the direction of better, not merely more. Better would be to release on time with a modest set of stable upgrades.	
						
> To block release while the one new feature gets sorted out would be a maladjustment of priorities. If 2.2 seems light on sex appeal, so be it. Better to keep the release date as promised.	

The 120 day release schedule was in danger of being completely missed by just one issue. Making major architectural changes to core just weeks before a release goes contrary to the aims of the new development process. A thread was opened up suggesting that the [release of 2.2 be delayed](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2007-April/011901.html). The architectural changes were too important to be done in an unsatisfactory way.

Eventually, a decision was made to [delay the 2.2 release](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2007-April/012090.html), pull tags out of core and bring in widgets as a user-facing feature to encourage users to upgrade.

Widgets were originally [developed by Andy Skelton](http://andy.wordpress.com/2006/03/08/widgets-user-interface-and-api/) for WordPress.com users, built as a way to give people more flexibility over the layout of their blog. They’re blocks of code that can be dragged and dropped into place through the user interface. Blog users can add a calendar, a search bar, or a piece of text, for example, to their sidebar and put them in whatever order they want. It was hugely popular amongst WordPress.com users and the plugin for WordPress users proved popular too. Launching a feature like this on WordPress.com first means that it can be tested on lots of different users before making it into core as a feature. 

Even today, WordPress core is merged with WordPress.com prior to release and features are tested on WordPress.com users. In 2006 [the consensus](https://codex.wordpress.org/IRC_Meetups/2006/June/June07RawLog) was that widgets would make an excellent addition to core, and when WordPress 2.2 looked like it would be feature-light with the absence of the new taxonomy structure, widgets were [brought in as a headline feature](http://wordpress.org/news/2007/05/wordpress-22/).	

The new tagging feature finally shipped in WordPress 2.3, and a much compromised and haggled over structure it was. The wrangling over the taxonomy structure has had lasting implications on WordPress developers ever since. Shared terms have had lasting implications for core developers, plugin developers, and users. The problem with shared terms is that an item could be conceptually different but it is treated the same in the database. For example, the word apple. A developer creates the taxonomy “Companies” and the taxonomy “Fruit” and user places the term “apple” in both. Conceptually, this is a different - a company and a fruit - and they appear in the user interface as different concepts, but the database treats them as the same thing. So if a user makes changes to one, like capitalizing it, for example, changes are made to both.

 In a post in 2013, [Andrew Nacin wrote that](http://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/07/28/potential-roadmap-for-taxonomy-meta-and-post-relationships/) “Hindsight is 20/20, and shared terms are the bane of taxonomies in WordPress.” Each term is represented in two different ways. Since an individual term can appear in multiple taxonomies, it’s not straightforward to identify the actual term in the actual taxonomy that you want. Every term has two ways to identify it. This has caused challenges for building new features that require using one identification when there are parts of WordPress that use the other. 

In order to attach metadata to a term, there needs to be only one object identifier but the public ID uses a different one. Consistently targeting data which is identified in multiple ways is extremely difficult. WordPress has a long-term commitment to maintaining backwards compatibility so just simply creating a new schema isn’t possible. The effort to get rid of shared terms needs to be done step by step, over a number of major releases, in which shared terms stop being created, they are split apart, slugs and names are moved from wp_terms to wp_term_taxonomy, and the wp_terms table is dropped (this is being carried out over three releases in the 4.x series).

The over-engineering taxonomy system came as the result of arguments and compromise. When the bazaar model works, it can produce software that people love to use. Where the bazaar model falls down is intractable arguments that result in a compromise that no one is 100% happy with. Since no one is able to make a definitive decision, compromises come in the worst of places. It did, however, have one positive benefit. Neither of the original proposals for the taxonomy schema (putting tags into the category table, or creating a new table for just tags) would have allowed for the creation of custom taxonomies, which were part of the transition of WordPress from a straightforward blogging platform to a content management system (CMS). 

 Even with these arguments, development of the software continued mostly on schedule. Since tags were pulled from 2.2, there were only 114 days between WordPress 2.1 and 2.2, and then 129 days between the release of 2.2 and 2.3. While delays happened in the future, there was nothing like the long dark year between 2.0 and 2.1.
