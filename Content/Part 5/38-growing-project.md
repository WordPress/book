## 38. Dealing with a Growing Project

By the time WordPress 3.0 launched more people were interested in the WordPress community and ecosystem than ever before. Always diverse, the community was becoming even more so. In the early days the project attracted developers, bloggers, and people interested in helping others via support or writing documentation. But several factors had meant that people of different backgrounds were getting more involved.

WordPress 2.7 demonstrated that making software is not just about writing code; design, user experience, UI expertise, and testing are all very much part of the process. To create user-friendly, useful software requires a diverse set of eyes. And the project needs to attract other contributors in addition to developers who enjoy writing code and releasing it for free. This means looking for ways to engage new contributors by making clear the different pathways to contribution.

Jen Mylo had been trying to clarify the ways that someone could take to get involved. While development, documentation, and support are obvious ways to participate, in 2009, Jen wrote about the different ways that people can participate in the project. One was [graphic design](https://wordpress.org/news/2009/04/contributing-to-wordpress-part-ii-graphic-design/). After a 2008 icon contest was successful, the project tried to find more ways for designers to contribute. A new Trac component for graphic design tasks was intiated, and designers were invited to get involved in WordPress' evolving visual design. People were also encouraged to get involved through [usability testing](https://wordpress.org/news/2009/05/testing-opps/). WordPress 2.7's success was due to the user testing that was part of the development cycle. The development team was keen to replicate this process in future releases. The final way Jen outlined included sharing [ideas, feedback, and opinions](https://wordpress.org/news/2009/05/ideas/). 

As well as her work on the development blog, Jen and other project leaders went to WordCamps to speak about getting involved with the community. Community developmenat was becoming as important as software development.

Project infrastructure changes also affected the project’s growth, particularly around the third party developer community. Both themes and plugins had become easier for users to access. Plugins usually received updates more quickly: the plugin directory launched in March 2007, WordPress 2.3 later that year introduced the plugin update notification system, and from WordPress 2.7 onward, users could install plugins straight from their admin screens. Theme improvements were similar, just a little later:  the theme directory was launched in July 2008, and the theme directory arrived on admin screens with WordPress 2.8 in 2009. Giving user more access to plugins and themes meant giving third party developers more access to users than ever. Both the theme and plugin directory were growing exponentially.[ graph of growth of themes and plugins] 

The theme directory was becoming more difficult to manage with the exponential theme growth. Joseph Scott ([josephscott](https://profiles.wordpress.org/josephscott)) developed the first version of the theme directory, and spent much of his time reviewing themes and providing feedback. A lot of the issues were related to security, but he also advised on best practices. There came a point, however, when the work was too much for one person. 

Joseph [wrote](https://wordpress.org/news/2010/06/expanding-the-theme-review-experiment/):	

> The theme directory has been chugging along for more than a year now. During that time we’ve tinkered with the review process and some of the management tools, but haven’t really opened it up as much as we’d like. It’s time to rip off the band-aid and take some action; to that end, we’re looking for community members to help with the process of reviewing themes for the directory.	

No one knew how the experiment would turn out. A [rush of people signed up for the new mailing list](http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/theme-reviewers/2010-June/); [guidelines were drawn up](http://codex.wordpress.org/index.php?title=Theme_Review&oldid=91889). Though the overall response was positive, some felt that the guidelines were too restrictive, that some of the theme requirements should instead be recommendations. On the WP Tavern forums, Justin Tadlock outlined some concerns, including the fact that the guidelines didn’t allow for themes with custom template hierarchies or custom image systems. Some people felt that the theme review team should restrict itself to looking for spam and other objectionable practices. Other developers simply decided to [remove their themes from the directory](http://quirm.net/2010/08/27/retiring-themes/).	

For those reviewing themes there were problems, particularly with manpower. The theme review queue was backed up with 100 themes by July 2010, with new themes being added every day. Only three to four people were actively reviewing themes. Over time, automated processes and new tools have improved the theme review process. For examplel the [theme check plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-check/) tests the theme against all of the latest theme review standards.	

But despite the teething problems, the theme reviewers have managed to create a system that benefits both users and developers: users get safe themes approved by WordPress.org and theme developers get feedback and help on their themes. There have been other, long-term, benefits. Joseph says now:

> looking back on it over the long term it's been nice to see some folks who started way back then and have gone on to be very successful as far as developing their own themes, commercial themes, while still supporting free and open source at the same time.  I think over the long term it's been rewarding to see that jumping off point for people to be able to continue to produce more themes, and very well regarded and high quality themes.

As the WordPress project diversified into concrete groups, communication needed to be improved. Core product development was discussed on wpdevel.wordpress.com, and the other teams were scattered over mailing lists and wordpress.com blogs. Towards the end of 2010, a new blog network was set up on WordPress.org -- make.WordPress.org became the new home for WordPress contributor teams, with blogs for Core, UI, theme review, and accessibility. Over time new blogs such as support, documentation, plugins, and community, have been added.

Each make.WordPress.org blog runs the P2 theme, Created by Automattic for internal communication, P2 is a microblogging tool that allows users to post on the front end, similar to Twitter, without the 140-character limit. Threaded comments on the post allow for discussion. Unless made completely open, only people who are editors of a blog can write a post while anyone is able to comment and P2 alters this paradigm. 	

This is an important centralized space on WordPress.org for contributors to gather. If a contributor is interested in Core development they can follow the Core blog, forum moderators can follow the support blog, people with a UI focus can follow the UI blog. Contributors can subscribe to the blogs and follow along with what’s going on from their email inboxes. While mailing lists are publicly archived, they often give the feeling of privacy because the contributor emails from their inbox and the mailing list archives are often difficult to find. By moving everything onto P2-themed blogs on make.WordPress.org, the conversation's tone has changed -- everything takes place in public. This encourages a more respectful attitude among community members. The focus is on getting work done rather than devolving into arguments.

These sorts of focused communication improvements have helped the project to build capacity and grow. What often happens is that a need appears, a call is put out, and if enough people answer the call, the project moves forward. Sometimes those projects, like the drive for Core plugins, aren’t successful, at other times they create a new area of contributor activity that people who weren’t so involved with the project before can really participate in. This sort of community and capacity building is an important part of running a successful free software project. For a free software project that has a large user base to succeed, there needs to be enough volunteers to protect the long-term sustainability of the project. As the community grows, needs change and new areas contribution areas open up. A project that grows so far beyond its hacker roots that it encompass a diverse set of contributors is a healthy one.
