## 39. Thesis
 
In mid-2010, one theme was still a GPL holdout: Thesis -- from DIYThemes -- created by theme designer Chris Pearson and blogger Brian Clark, was one of the most popular themes around. It's feature-heavy, giving users many more options than most WordPress themes. Users can customize every element of their website via the user interface. On the original about page [Chris states Thesis' aim](https://web.archive.org/web/20080610074529/http://diythemes.com/thesis/about/): "I wanted a framework that had it all -- killer typography, a dynamically resizable layout, intelligent code, airtight optimization, and tons of flexibility." [Techn blogs featured Thesis](http://thenextweb.com/2008/07/17/thesis-represents-the-next-generation-of-wordpress-themes/#!A2Baz) and high profile bloggers, including [Matt Cutts](http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/switching-things-around/), [Chris Brogan](http://www.chrisbrogan.com/thesis-wordpress-theme/), and [Darren Rowse](http://www.problogger.net/archives/2008/07/18/thesis-a-wordpress-theme-design-worth-considering/) adopted it.

Chris Pearson was well-respected in the community, having already developed Cutline and PressRow before moving into the premium theme market with Thesis. Thesis itself was influential to theme development. A [mid-2009 ThemeShaper post talks about](http://themeshaper.com/2009/05/21/design-popular-wordpress-theme-chris-pearsons-secret/) "The Pearson Principle": "Bloggers want powerfully simple design on an equally robust framework." With themes such as Revolution and Premium News, theme developers were already moving into creating themes packed with features, but Thesis cemented that move. Simple design on the front-end with options for full website customization. It was the era of the theme framework [^fn-1], when a theme framework had as many features as WordPress itself, with heavy user customizations via the options panel. [Chris called this](http://themeshaper.com/2009/05/21/design-popular-wordpress-theme-chris-pearsons-secret/comment-page-1/#comment-9718) "ubiquitous design" -- a theme was no longer just a website skin but a tool to build your website. It took another four years before theme developers stopped packing themes with options and started moving features into plugins.

While theme vendors adopted the GPL, Thesis held out. Discussions [between DIYThemes and Automattic](http://pomomusings.com/2009/06/04/switch-wordpress-blog/#comment-59022) went nowhere.  Relationships were already fractious between WordPress and DIYThemes. In June 2009, with discussions ongoing between Brian and Toni, a blogger's comment thread was [hijacked](http://pomomusings.com/2009/06/04/switch-wordpress-blog/). A long debate about Thesis and the GPL ensued. Matt urges people to move away from Thesis, saying "if you care about the philosophical underpinnings of WordPress please consider putting your support behind something that isn't hostile to WordPress' core freedoms and GPL license."

Later, during three weeks in July 2010, the debate between WordPress and Thesis raged. All of the major tech news sites took notice. It was ignited after Chris Pearson's interview [on Mixergy](http://mixergy.com/chris-pearson-thesis-interview/). In it, Chris shares Thesis' revenue figures, putting a conservative estimate at 1.2 million dollars within 16 to 18 months.  

Just over a week later, [Matt and Chris took to Twitter.](https://twitter.com/pearsonified/status/18536597161). Matt was unhappy about Chris flaunted his revenue while violating WordPress' license. Cutting remarks went back and forth until Andrew Warner from Mixergy decided to set up an [impromptu debate to discuss the issues live](http://mixergy.com/chris-pearson-matt-mullenweg/). The hour-long discussion airs both sides of the argument. Matt argues that Thesis is built on GPL software -- WordPress -- and therefore should honor the license. By not doing so, he suggests that Chris is disrespectful of all WordPress authors and that he's breaking the law. For Chris, adopting the GPL means giving up his rights and losing his protection from piracy. He argues that "what I've done stands alone outside of WordPress completely," and that Thesis "does not inherit anything from WordPress." The argument descends into a rambling discussion of economics, and the conversation ends with Matt saying that he's willing to sue Chris if he's not willing to comply with the GPL. 

Matt, Automattic, and WordPress took public action against Thesis, following the interview. [Matt offered to buy Thesis users an alternative premium theme](https://twitter.com/photomatt/status/18548422506), consultants using Thesis were [removed from the Code Poet directory of WordPress consultants](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mg315/4792383313/), and Chris Pearson's other themes, Cutline and PressRow, were [removed from WordPress.com](http://www.pearsonified.com/2010/11/former-cutline-pressrow-theme-user.php). 

Matt wasn't the only person involved with WordPress to come out against Thesis. Other lead and core developers wrote about their GPL / Thesis stance. [Ryan Boren wrote](http://ryan.boren.me/2010/07/15/wordpress-theme-licensing/), "where do I stand as one of the primary copyright holders of WordPress? I'd like to see the PHP parts of themes retain the GPL. Aside from preserving the spirit of WordPress, respecting the open source ecosystem in which it thrives, and avoiding questionable legal ground, retaining the GPL is practical." Mark Jaquith [wrote about how WordPress themes don't sit on top of WordPress](http://markjaquith.wordpress.com/2010/07/17/why-wordpress-themes-are-derivative-of-wordpress/) but are interdependent on it. A theme is combined WordPress:

> in multiple different places, with multiple interdependencies. This forms a web of shared data structures and code all contained within a shared memory space. If you followed the code execution for Thesis as it jumped between WordPress core code and Thesis-specific code, you'd get a headache, because you'd be jumping back and forth literally hundreds of times.

Even developers who don’t agree that a theme is necessarily derivative of WordPress thought that Thesis itself was derivative. Developer Drew Blas [wrote a script that took every line of WordPress and compared it with Thesis.](http://drewblas.com/2010/07/15/an-analysis-of-gpled-code-in-thesis/) His script pulled up a number of instances of Thesis code taken from WordPress. Core developer Andrew Nacin [pointed out](http://nacin.com/2010/07/15/thesis-gpl/) that Thesis' own inline documentation read "This function is mostly copy pasta from WP (wp-includes/media.php), but with minor alteration to play more nicely with our styling."

A former employee of DIY Themes [left a comment on Matt's blog](http://ma.tt/2010/07/syn-thesis-1/#comment-481845): 

> check out Thesis' handling of comments (thesis/lib/classes/comments.php). Large chunks of it are ripped right from WordPress. I know they are… because I'm the one who did the ripping. Whether I informed Chris of that or not doesn't matter because I no longer have any of our old chat logs to prove one way or another, but suffice it to say the latest public release of Thesis (and numerous versions before hand) contain obviously GPL code. Whether those portions get rewritten in the impending 3.0 release, I don't know… but for Chris to claim that he was responsible for and devised all of Thesis at 13:33 or so in the debate… Well, he was lying to you, either intentionally or not.

On July 22nd -- not even a week after the initial Mixergy interview -- [Chris Pearson announced](https://twitter.com/pearsonified/status/19288707443) that Thesis would be released with a split license. The public furore compounded by pressure from inside DIY Themes forced Chris to capitulate. Brian Clark drafted [the license,](http://technosailor.com/2010/07/29/exclusive-interview-brian-clark-leaves-diythemesthesis-theme/) shortly before leaving DIYThemes, citing "completely different opinions about the direction of the development of Thesis, the running of the company, and our relationship with the WordPress community." When Thesis 2 launched in 2012 it had a new, proprietary, license.

The debate around Thesis and the GPL had far-reaching implications on everyone involved. [Prominent blogs moved away from Thesis](http://ma.tt/2010/08/syn-thesis-3-switchers/). Brian Gardner's Genesis theme became a popular choice. Thesis and Chris Pearson became less prominent in the community, focusing instead on cultivating and building a large customer base. The debacle also made it clear that WordPress is prepared to go to court when developers flagrantly abuse the license. There was, for a while, a relative calm in the community around the GPL. WordPress.org supported commercial theme sellers whose themes were 100% GPL and tolerated those that packaged their themes with two licenses. So when the next argument around the GPL flared up, this time it was about focused on the spirit of the GPL, as opposed to its legality. 

[^fn-1] The term “theme framework” is often used to refer to different things. In some instances, a theme framework is a base, or “starter” theme that a developer can build from. In other cases it’s a drop-in code library that facilitates development. But it’s also used in marketing to users, when a theme framework is a feature-heavy theme with multiple options.
