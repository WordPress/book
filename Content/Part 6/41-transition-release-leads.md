## 41. The Transition to Release Leads

From late 2011 onward, the development process saw experimentation and refinement. The development process wasn't optimum: it lacked accountability, there were bottlenecks and missed deadlines. Each release from WordPress 3.4 saw a major change to the development process, and it wasn’t until WordPress 3.8 that these experimentations in process settled down.

This experimentation period started at the core team meetup in Tybee in December 2011. At that meetup, most of the lead developers, committers, and active core developers discussed the project’s issues and roadmap. This discussion informed the [scope setting meeting for WordPress 3.4](https://irclogs.wordpress.org/chanlog.php?channel=wordpress-dev&day=2012-01-04&sort=asc#m349775) on January 4th 2012.

The scope chat notes cover the [breadth of issues discussed](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2012/01/05/dev-chat-notes-01042012/). The team acknowledged that there was a problem with process. Jen notes some of the issues: “lack of good time estimation, resource bottlenecks, lack of accountability, unknown/variable time commitments/disappearing devs, overassignment of tasks to some people, reluctance to cut features to meet deadline.” The team proposed changes to solve these problems.

They decided to split feature development into teams, where two contributors would lead each team. This was to reduce instances where community members over-extended themselves and the chance that a contributor would abandon a project because of competing life priorities. 

Ideally, these feature teams should be a led by lead developer or committer paired with a newer contributor to help engage and mentor new contributors. Each team was responsible for posting regular updates and for delivering their feature on time. They created a schedule with overlapping cycles that encompassed development, UX, and bug fixes to reduce bottlenecks.

They also decided that releases would have a specific focus. WordPress 3.3 had been a cluster of disparate features, some of which had been pulled because they weren't ready. WordPress 3.4 was the first cycle to have an overarching focus -- appearance/switching themes. The development team worked on improving both front-end and admin features that adjust a sites’s appearance. 

Between WordPress 3.4 and 3.5 the approach to project leadership evolved. These changes started back in WordPress 3.0 when Dion Hulse became a committer. Though Dion received commit access, he was not made a lead developer. This was the first step toward decoupling the lead developer position from commit access. The team felt that commit access, while being a symbol of trust and responsibility, should not necessarily lead to a person becoming a lead developer. To reduce bottlenecks, the project needed committers but not necessarily more lead developers. Separating the roles offered opportunities for strong coders and patch triagers. Additionally, some contributors may not be suited for or even want a more general leadership role.

And yet, some were confused about what the lead developer title actually entailed; individual core team members saw the role differently and no one agreed on what the lead developer title meant. For Mark Jaquith, the lead developer role has changed organically over the years. To begin with, the role related only to coding. [Over time it transitioned, particularly around the growth of WordCamps](http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2013_11_22_Jaquith.html#L30): "we started going around and talking to users about some of the philosophy behind WordPress and the direction we wanted to take. It became more of a general leadership role in practice." The role also evolved as lead developers worked with the community: often, lead developers responded to comment threads to address issues, or speak up on behalf of the project. 
			
However, the role had never been formally clarified. While the lead developers handled many coding decisions, their additional responsibilities and authority were unclear. Did they have authority across the project? Should they make decisions in areas such as WordCamps, documentation, or theme review?		
		
The lead developer role "didn't really have a set of responsibilities assigned with it or expectations,” [says Matt](http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2014_07_07_Mullenweg.html#L214). According to him, the lead developer leads development, not other areas of the project; he believes that coupling authority and responsibility with a development role makes it difficult for non-coders to achieve project authority and responsibility. 		

[Matt had articulated as much, as early as 2005](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2005-June/001417.html), when he stated that commit access did not mean equate to community status. It may never have been Matt’s intention to automatically confer authority on people with commit access, though extending commit demonstrated that committers had earned trust, and, as such, people naturally looked to committers as community and code leaders. Since roles and responsibilities were undefined, people simply perceived commit access as a general leadership role.
					
In June 2012, these differences and the confusion around the role brought conflict. Since WordPress 3.0 onward, a new generation of developers had been driving development. Contributor changes were marked between the 2010 core meetup in Orlando and the 2011 meetup in Tybee. In 2010 just the small team of lead developers (Mark Jaquith, Andrew Ozz, Peter Westwood, Matt, and Ryan Boren along with Jen) met up. In 2011 the meetup had new faces including Dion Hulse, [Jon Cave](http://profiles.wordpress.org/duck_), Daryl Koopersmith, and Andrew Nacin.

From time to time, someone arrives and has a large influence on the project. In the early days, Ryan Boren drove WordPress' development, but post-WordPress 3.0, it was Andrew Nacin. "Nacin like Ryan is one of those guys that just has an ability to get in a flow, and just really crank and get focused intensely, and get through a ton of work," [says Matt](http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2014_07_07_Mullenweg.html#L196).

Nacin’s project influence grew and between WordPress 3.4 and 3.5. Ryan Boren proposed that since Nacin was driving releases just as strongly, he deserved recognition and should be made a lead developer.

Rather than appointing Nacin as a lead developer immediately, Matt proposed an organizational shift in the project. Matt argued that the lead developer title was historical and non-meritocratic, that leadership roles should be held by those driving the project today. Matt wanted opportunities for a new generation of developers to assume project leadership roles. He proposed that, instead of having a small group of lead developers, the project move to release leads, nominating Andrew Nacin and Daryl Koopersmith to assume the role in the next release. Matt's proposal offered clear authority to individuals for a given release; release leads would have final say, both over the lead developers, and over Matt. Some in the "historical and un-meritocratic" roles perceived this move as an attempt to remove the old guard to make way for the new. While a number of the lead developers aren’t active in core on a daily basis, they are in regular contact with those who work on core, providing advice on architecture and development.

On reflection, Matt says that there was a misunderstanding. He said that he didn't mean to infer that the people holding lead developer roles were worthless or irrelevant, but that the roles did not reflect the reality of the project today. "A source of some of the conflict," [says Matt](http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2014_07_07_Mullenweg.html#L214), "is this idea that the lead developers sort of had the same role as me where they had sort of purview over everything across all parts of WordPress." 

The lead developer role discussion raised dissatisfaction around project decision making. Many of those who ran day-to-day development felt that unilateral decisions were made without consultation with the rest of the team. Matt had taken a less active role in recent years, as Jen and Ryan, supported by the other lead developers, drove the project, yet decisions had been made and announced without consultation. This was a culmination of other issues within the core development team and in the wider project: checking in code without consultation, providing feedback only toward the end of a release, and decisions around WordPress.org -- the site Matt owns, but that influnces the entire community.
	
In response, some core team members -- including lead developers and other team members -- sent a group email to Matt to express their discontent with how the project had been run. They felt that Matt’s perspective on the project's organization, authority, and responsibility, didn’t reflect the project's realities. While Matt believed that the lead developer role was a code leadership position only, leadership extended beyond coding in practice. The group proposed an official project leadership team, and to retain the lead developer title as a meritocratic title for those core developers who had demonstrated leadership, code expertise, mentored new developers, and who had been strongly aligned with WordPress' philosophies. While the group happily supported the release leads proposal, they felt that the decisions for architecture, code, and implementation should rest with the lead developers, and that decisions affecting the project should lie with a leadership team. 
			
In response, those involved scheduled a Google Hangout to discuss the issues, air grievances, and find a way forward. As a result of the hangout, some things changed, and the [first 3.5 release cycle post](http://make.wordpress.org/core/2012/07/11/recognition-and-news-about-the-3-5-cycle/) reflects some of those changes. Andrew Nacin was promoted to the lead developer role, and core development adopted release leads with responsibility for an individual release cycle. The role of lead developer remains within the project.

They chose media as the scope for the 3.5 release; it was an area that the development team had wanted to tackle for some time but with such a large scope, it hadn't been attempted. Daryl Koopersmith created a plugin, called [Mosaic](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mosaic/), which was the prototype for the new media management. Much of it was written in Javascript, where Daryl's expertise lay. But as a PHP free software project, there were few who could help him. As a result, Andrew and Daryl spent between 80 - 100 hours a week working on the release.

While the release itself was well received, and media received the overhaul it needed, the actual development cycle wasn't such a success. It was a huge amount of work, involving lots of feedback, codebase iterations, and coding a whole new feature from scratch. There were four major iterations to the user interface, including one 72 hours before the release. This meant that the new "release leads approach" got off to a faltering start. The intent was to have  release leads guide and lead a release, not necessarily spend hours carrying out heroic coding feats. Once again, the release cycle was driven by focusing on a single feature and the only reason it was complete was because two coders broke their backs getting it done. But it was the next release cycle, 3.6, that made it clear that it wasn’t the structure of the development team that was broken, but the actual model of developing features for a specific release.
