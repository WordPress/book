We live in a highly networked world. Billions of people engage and interact with one another online. Never has the world seemed smaller. Global communication is instantaneous. We can converse across the world, learn about other cultures and meet new people without leaving our own home. The ways in which people get online are as varied as the people who populate the internet. People connect on social media, communicate using applications, build websites using everything from hand-coded CSS and HTML to content management systems.

The web is built on free and open source software: server-side software like Apache and Nginx, application frameworks like Ruby on Rails, databases like MySQL, and security cryptographic protocols like OpenSLL. This software is often built by hackers and hobbiests, who distribute it freely, hack on it, patch it, and share it with one another. But free software isn't just the domain of hardcore coders -- those who build the underlying fabric of the web. Millions of people, for example, use tools like the open source browser Firefox to browse the web.

And then there is WordPress, the user-focused publishing platform built to make it easy for anyone to get online. At the time of this writing, it powered almost 24% of websites, and is used by millions of people worldwide. Users vary from casual bloggers to international news sites, small businesses to big businesses, charities, non-profits, networks, and personal portfolios. What started out as just a blogging platform is now the most widely-used content management system on the internet and is even used by some developers as an application framework.

With so much of the internet powered by WordPress, it's no surprise that the people who use it are as diverse as those who use the internet itself. Each website represents a different story, a different individual or organization who has a stake in being online and in providing a window into their world. This book tells the story of WordPress, a tool created by a couple of hackers and developed by volunteers from all over the world. But before that story begins, it's worth looking at the stories of just a few of those who have been empowered by the software.

**Fighting Human Rights Abuse**
_Thailand, near the Burmese Border_ 

Burma is the stage for one of the longest-running civil wars in history. Since 1948, different ethnic minorities have struggled for independence. The military junta has committed innumerable atrocoties against the people of Burma, particularly in ethnic areas: torture and executions, rape, kidnapping, and chemical attacks on citizens. It has left millions of people living like refugees in their own country, displaced from their homes and under attack from their government.

Since 1997, the Free Burma Rangers (FBR) have delivered humanitarian relief to internally displaced persons (IDPs). Operating from regions around Burma's borders, relief teams of up to six people enter Burma's jungles to provide emergency medical relief, humanitarian assistance, and counselling to IDPs. The teams are made up of Burmese nationals, many of whom have themselves been displaced, who themselves have been victims of the government's military rule.

In addition to humanitarian relief, the teams gather documentary evidence about atrocities and human rights abuses in Burma. Every team has a member whose job it is to document atrocities using photography, video, and interviews. This evidence is trekked out of the jungle, over the border, and forms an archive of the human rights abuses committed by the junta.

For many years, these documents were simply stored on paper. Offices full of paper held evidence of years of abuse. The information was tabulated into spreadsheets and documents. Photographs and videos were stored on stacks of hard drives. To find information, a person had to spend hours looking for it. There was no way to look at the data in aggregate, to find patterns and trends. 

With the help of a team of volunteers, the FBR's hundreds of thousands of records were converted into a digital database that allows rangers to quickly upload and disseminate information. The system needed to be usable by the rangers, many of whom had little computing experience, and many of whom speak different languages and dialects. When the project got to the point of user testing, the site was tested in a hut in the jungle on a laptop plugged into a solar cell, with a satellite internet connection.

*User testing in a hut in the jungle*

Reports are stored on two sites -- an internal site for storing and tracking all of the reports, and a [public-facing website](http://www.freeburmarangers.org) which is used to disseminate information to the public. Both of these websites are built using WordPress. While on a relief mission, a team takes notes on human rights violations, documenting the location, taking photos, and recording interviews. They do the same thing for any patients they see, recording everything in a paper journal. When the relief mission is complete, the journal and SD card are trekked out of the jungle and the information is added to the website.
 
The digitization of all of these reports has meant that volunteers can spend less time digging for information and more time improving relief, training, and providing aid. It's made analysis more efficient and effective, allowing training teams to look for patterns that will improve aid.
 
But it's also helped the ease with which the FBR can disseminate information about atrocities to the world. In December 2012, one of the IDPs working with the Free Burma Rangers hiked through the jungle to deliver video and photographs of the Burmese military using attack helicopters and jet fighters in air strikes against ethnic rebels in the northern Kachin state. The images were [published on the blog](http://www.freeburmarangers.org/2013/01/01/photos-of-burma-air-force-jets-and-mi24-attack-helicopters-bombing-rocketing-and-strafing-the-kachin-in-kachin-state-northern-burma/). The next day, the [BBC picked up the images](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-20886377), broadcasting them around the world. These images increased international pressure on the Burmese military and played a significant role in the 2013 ceasefire.
 
**Charting a dream journey**
 _On the road, USA._ 

For nearly five years, Maria Scarpello has been traveling the highways and byways of America, sampling beer, in search of that perfect pint. She travels in an RV she calls Stanley, a 1999 Class C Ford Jayco. Stanley isn't just an RV, it's her home. "Home is where my wheels are," says Maria. She parks the RV wherever she can, from campgrounds to street corners, from parking lots to friends' driveways, and, from time to time, a parking lot. Stanley has been adapted to her life on the road. The bed has been removed from the back of the RV, replaced with a couch to give additional space to work, relax, and hang out with her two dogs Ernie and Buddha.

Her first blog, [TrippingWithStanley.com](http://trippinwithstanley.com) charted the first year-and-a-half of her journey across America; from zip lines in Las Vegas to golfing in Phoenix, barren deserts in Arizona, to the rocky cliffs of the Oregon coast. When Maria left home, she had planned to travel for only six months, but the five years she has lived in her RV are a testament to how deeply she has fallen in love with life on the road.

<img src="../Resources/images/introduction/maria-1.JPG" alt="Maria Scarpello" width="600px"/>

*Maria at Golden Canyon in Death Valley National Park*

Her current website, [The Roaming Pint](http://theroamingpint.com) is a travelog of all of the breweries that she has visited in America. Through the site, beer lovers can vicariously visit America's breweries and search the website to get information about the hundreds of breweries she's visited.

To support her trip, Maria had to find work that would work with her fluid lifestyle. To begin with, she planned to make money through her blog -- plenty of people fund their travels by blogging, so why not? However, making money purely from a blog is no easy task, and after a year on the road Maria decided money via the blog was not sustainable enough to solely support the lifestyle she wanted to maintain. For the past three years, Maria has worked at a WordPress Theme Shop, WooThemes, as the Internal Community Manager. Armed with a mobile hotspot and her laptop, she has everything she needs to make money while she is on the road. Her office is the RV. It's been completely renovated to make it feel like home: the walls are painted bright green and are decorated with stickers, coasters, pictures, and other souvenirs from her travels. The view from her office is always changing. "Next month my office will be overlooking the beautiful white capped Rockies in one of my favorite states -- Colorado," says Maria "the following month we will be venturing even further west, eventually making our way back to the coast. There is no better office view for me than overlooking vast bodies of water, preferably with palm trees or mountain side cliffs and sandy beaches begging me to put my MacBook Air away and let the dogs play!"

**Running a Small Business**
 _Fjærland, Norway._ 
 
Eivind Ødegård arrives at his office and heads straight for his coffee machine. Coffee in hand, he sits down at his computer and starts reading email. He is surrounded by books: they fill the shelves that line the walls of his room, they are stacked all over the floor. Much of his day is spent in front of the computer, handling money and bills, dealing with correspondence, and processing orders. It sounds like a job that could be done in any office, but his view is quite different from the normal nine-to-five. From his window he can see the ferries that bring tourists in and out to the tiny town of Fjærland. They come to Fjærland for the glacier, the majestic scenery, and [Norway's booktown](http://bokbyen.no/), of which Eivind is the manager.

Fjærland is a rural community with less than 300 inhabitants. Is is ringed by mountains and glaciers. Waterfalls run down the mountainsides along the fjords where dolphins and seal hunt for fish. In the summer, it is hot and sunny and busy with tourists; in the winter, the weather turns cold and the local inhabitants -- cut off from the rest of the world -- plan for the coming summer. 

<img src="../Resources/images/introduction/booktown1.JPG" alt="Fjaerland booktown" width="600px" />
*The booktown at Fjærland (photo credit: Trond J. Hansen.)*

The booktown that Eivind manages was a local initiative to reinvigorate the town. A [booktown is](http://booktown.net/) "a small rural town or village in which second-hand and antiquarian bookshops are concentrated. Most Book Towns have developed in villages of historic interest or of scenic beauty." The first was in Hay-on-Wye in Wales, but currently there are booktowns all over the world. In Fjærland, the booktown was established in 1995 to solve a specific problem. Buildings in the town were derelict and falling into disrepair. Rather than watch the town fall into ruin, the townspeople filled them with books. Second-hand books fill stables, boathouses, a bank and a post office, a grocery shop, and a ferry waiting room. Each shop has its speciality, one even doubles as the tourist information office. Some bookshops are staffed, others operate by an honor system - customers leave money in an honesty book whenever they take a book.

<img src="../Resources/images/introduction/booktown2.JPG" alt="Fjaerland booktown with customer" width="600px" />

*A customer browses the books (photo credit: Trond J. Hansen.)*

Some of Eivind's time every day is spent managing and updating the [booktown's website](http://bokbyen.no/). The website is a window for the rest of the world into this secluded community. The site provides information about the booktown, while the blog has news from Fjærland. There is also an online store from which the booktown distributes publications from Sjørettsfondet, the [Norweigan Maritime Law Foundation](http://www.sjorettsfondet.no/English.htm). The website, maintained in both Norweigan and English, is built on WordPress.

**Building the Web**
_New York, New York_ 

Some blogs have been around long before blog software even existed, long before WordPress or MovableType or Livejournal. These were hand-coded websites where people shared their thoughts and links from around the web. The longest-running of these blogs chart not just the evolution of a person, but the evolution of the web. Jeffrey Zeldman's blog is one such example. It's a record of many of the important trends and changes in technology and design that have happened ever since the mid-1990s, complemented by asides and personal reflections that illustrate the world as it is has changed along with the web.

Prior to the advent of blogging as its own form, Jeffrey used his website to entertain and create. His archives are a treasure-trove of 1990s design artefacts: [banners from zeldman.com](http://www.zeldman.com/zlink.html), [desktop backgrounds](http://www.zeldman.com/desktops/), and 8-bit [pixel art icons](http://www.zeldman.com/icon1.html). 

Reading through the blog archives is like taking a tour through the history of the modern web. From the early days of web standards, when many designers were building beautiful sites with Flash and others were crafting web pages with CSS, through the popularisation of the semantic web, from the growth of social networks and the skepticism around them, to the introduction of responsive web design. These changes in the web are woven through the blog, with personal comments on them, from Zeldman’s own particular perspective: the evolution of the web recorded with thoughts by one of the people so central in shaping the web today.

But there's more to Jeffrey's blog than just musing about the web. Even while he was still hand-coding his website, he started a section called “My Glamorous Life”, where he[wrote about himself](http://www.zeldman.com/glamorous/glamorous.html). The tag “glamorous” is still what he uses to tag posts that are about him, rather than about someone else. Woven between posts about the web are posts about Jeffrey himself, and as with all diarists, there's a lot we can learn about him. He’s a web designer who cares passionately about web standards. He’s a publisher and an event organiser. He hosts a regular podcast called “The Big Web Show”. But there’s more than just that, more than just what he _does_. He has a daughter, Ava. He's divorced, though long after the divorce he still looks after his ex's two small dogs when she is ill (much to the annoyance of his neighbours). He has family secrets that, now and again, come out of the closet. He’s a fan of Edward Hopper and John Coltrane. He surrounds himself by smart people who he respects. He loves what he does and he wants you to like it too.

This blending of the personal and the professional is the mark of many blogs. After all, for the writer, these things are just different aspects of who they are. "I don't really see a big difference between sharing what's the personal and sharing opinions about web design and sharing information about web design. It's all the same, " says Jeffrey.  He continues in the same fashion today, blogging on WordPress about the web, sharing news about his different projects, and telling stories from his glamourous life.

**Giving People a Voice**
_Worldwide_ 

All over the world, citizen journalists tell their stories on the web. The past fifteen years have seen publishing tools go from the hands of a few media outlets and into the hands of the many. Those who traditionally formed the audience, are now able to participate in the process of reporting the news. Individuals share their stories and unique perspectives from locales all over the world. 

Global Voices Online is one of the largest international networks of bloggers and citizen journalists. Using WordPress, the team of writers reports from 167 countries, and their stories are translated into more than 30 languages. Founded in 2004 by Ethan Zuckerman and Rebecca MacKinnon with the aim of highlighting bloggers who build bridges between languages and cultures, its mission has evolved to "find the most compelling and important stories coming from marginalized and misrepresented communities," as well as speaking out against online censorship and helping people find new ways to gain access to the internet.

"People no longer only get their news from governments and the media, but have a wider variety of sources to enjoy. Especially when it comes to societies that have limited freedom of expression that's hugely important," says [Solana Larsen](http://globalvoicesonline.org/author/solana-larsen/), former managing editor. "Ordinary citizens can help change the way current events are perceived and remembered in history."

Since its launch, bloggers on Global Voices Online have written about some of the most significant events happening world. In March 2011, bloggers in Japan [wrote with horror](http://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/2011-special-coverage/japan-earthquake-tsunami-2011/) about the 8.9 magnitude earthquake that resulted in over 10,000 deaths and damaged the Fukushima powerplant. The same year, [bloggers at Global Voices Online](http://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/2011-special-coverage/tunisia-uprising-201011/) were among those in Tunisia who provided eyewitness accounts of the revolution that toppled the government. In Egypt [bloggers wrote about the reolvution](http://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/2011-special-coverage/egypt-protests-2011/#timeline) that led to the downfall of Hosni Mubarak. In 2014, bloggers from West Africa wrote about the Ebola crises which has swept Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone. Bloggers write to remind [the world that they are more than just a virus](http://globalvoicesonline.org/2014/10/24/west-africans-keep-calm-despite-ebola-and-remind-the-world-who-they-are/), to [highlight the work of scientists and medics](http://globalvoicesonline.org/2014/08/23/the-heroic-everyday-work-of-lab-technicians-in-the-fight-against-ebola-in-liberia/), and to share [successes in the fight against the disease](http://globalvoicesonline.org/2014/08/27/nigeria-successfully-curtails-ebola-to-one-patient/).

But it's not just the world-shaking events that get written about, bloggers write about what it's like to live in their countries, sometimes from repressive regimes where voices are so easily silenced. In Russia, a blogger writes about how the internet has [become a battleground for LGBT rights](http://globalvoicesonline.org/2015/01/31/grindr-in-the-kremlin-gay-and-online-in-putins-russia/). In Skopje, Macdeonia, shoppers protest against [government plans to makeover buildings in a neoclassical or baroque style](http://globalvoicesonline.org/2014/12/30/macedonians-hug-skopje-shopping-centre-to-protect-it-from-baroque-isation/). [Syria prepares for its first TEDx conference](http://globalvoicesonline.org/2015/01/14/is-syria-ready-for-tedx-damascus-with-its-free-thinkers-dead-in-jail-or-exile/). In Ecuador, the Guaycan trees come into bloom, [flooding the world with yellow](http://globalvoicesonline.org/2015/02/01/a-marvelous-display-of-yellow-in-ecuador/). Each of these stories is a window onto another part of the world, giving the reader a glimpse of what it is like to live somewhere else, in a different set of circumstances.

These are just a few of the stories of those who use WordPress, people who have been able to tell their stories and share their own unique perspectives on the web. But the software itself has a story, one that stretches back even before WordPress itself was launched. Like so many pieces of free software, It didn't start out with financial backing, it wasn't built by a company with aims and objectives. It was a small discarded blogging script that was picked up by two hackers who wanted to use it to power their blogs. So how did it come to dominate the web? Why is it so popular? And who are the people who made the software what it is today? This book charts the story of WordPress, from its humble beginnings as a few lines of code written in an apartment above a bar in Corsica, to the dominant web platform that it is today.
