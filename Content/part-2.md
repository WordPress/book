Founding Philosophies
Simplicity and usability

After WordPress 0.7 launched, Matt outlined his thoughts on the future of WordPress on [WordPress.org](http://WordPress.org). Even then, [he maintained that](http://web.archive.org/web/20031002112415/http://wordpress.org/about/future/) "one thing that will never change is our commitment to web standards and an unmatched user experience," --- principles that guide WordPress development to the present day. These principles reflect the fact that the software's developers were also its users. WordPress grew out of a need to publish easily to an elegant, semantic website. And who better to drive development forward, than the users of that software?

Web standards

WordPress' first improvements focused on HTML semantics and web standards. After initializing the repository in CVS, the version control system then in use, and uploading the files, Matt made basic semantic changes to the `index.php` file. He fixed whitespace issues, and converted `<div>` tags into heading tags. Using the correct tags to generate proper headings reinforced the content's semantic meaning on the webpage WordPress generated. Matt also enhanced `index.php`'s default structure, aiming for XHTML strict compliance. Matt and Mike were both committed to standards compliance. Matt often wrote about the [importance of standards compliance](http://ma.tt/2004/03/code-is-food/) (in 2004 he would [become a member](http://ma.tt/2004/05/sting/) of the [web standards project](http://www.webstandards.org)) while Mike wrote enthusiastically about his employer's [first standards-compliant website](http://zed1.com/journalized/archives/2003/11/21/zendor-standards-compliant-website-launched/). This iterative approach, along with strict standards compliance, would define WordPress' development over the coming ten years.

Working with b2 had its own challenges. Michel [admits](http://wordpress.tv/2012/02/27/les-origines-de-wordpress-la-naissance-de-b2cafelog/) that he was learning how to write PHP when he wrote b2\. The result: some inefficient code and techniques counter-intuitive to an experienced coder. Michel's code reflected a developer learning PHP. Rather than taking a modular approach to solve a logic problem, the code grew organically, written as Michel thought about it. Code wasn't so much a tool to solve a problem, but a tool to get the newest feature on the screen. This created multiple code interdependencies which could cause problems for developers new to the project. A line of code would change, and break something that appeared unrelated. It wasn't all bad, however. Michel's inexperience also meant that the code had a level of simplicity that made it easy for other developers to understand. Whereas a more experienced developer might write complex code, Michel often took the simplest route to solve a problem. "In a way it was beautiful because it was so simple," says developer Alex King, [alexkingorg](http://profiles.wordpress.org/alexkingorg/), "It wasn't elegant but it was very straightforward and very accessible. For someone who didn't have a lot of development experience coming in --- like me --- it was very comfortable understanding what was going on."

During the initial development period, Matt and Mike had commit access to the repository; both could make changes to WordPress whenever they felt like it. They used their own experience as bloggers, as well as their b2 forum activity, to guide them. "As bloggers, we had similar desires to those other people had," says Mike. "I seem to remember still sticking around the b2 forums and looking at what people were asking about and what people wanted while it was still in b2 and getting inspiration and ideas from that."

However, much of the early work simply involved refactoring code and making tweaks. With Matt's changes to the admin screens, the first version of WordPress looked very different to b2, but under-the-hood the changes were minor.

Early on, developer Dougal Campbell questioned whether b2 should be rewritten, or whether the code base should simply be built upon. On the support forum, he asked [how far the developers intended to go with the rewrite](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/how-much-will-you-rewrite#post-16): were they planning to rewrite the whole codebase from scratch, or would something recognizably b2 still remain? [Matt said](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/how-much-will-you-rewrite#post-33) they planned to structure the code more logically as they went along. Object oriented code was the long-term goal to facilitate code readability and usability.
GPL

The GPL protects four freedoms that constitute "free software." It's important to note that the word "free" in this context does not apply to price; it refers to freedom, which is the underlying ethos that drives the Free Software Foundation. This choice of the word "free" in this context has dogged the FSF throughout its life. The uninitiated often think that "free" refers to cost and the FSF often has to qualify it with the statement "free as in freedom, not as in beer". 

[Free software protects four essential freedoms](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html):

- 0 The freedom to run the program, for any purpose.
- 1 The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish.
- 2 The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbour
- 3 The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others. 

These can be summarised as "the users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software." The freedoms are protected for all users of the work. 

The GPL employs what Stallman calls "copyleft", which subverts the normal use of copyright laws to protect the terms under which the work can be distributed and redistributed. It's a method of making a work free and of requiring that all extended and modified versions of the work are free as well. In this way, the copyright holder can ensure that their work does not end up being part of a proprietary model.

Copyleft works in the following way:
1. The copyright holder asserts that they hold the copyright to the work
2. To this is added the terms of distribution. This says that anyone can use, modify, and redistribute the work, provided they pass the same freedom on to everyone else.

If a programmer wants to use a copylefted work in his or her own software, then that new work must provide the same freedoms as the original work. Copyright, which is so often use to inhibit freedom is turned on its head. It is used against itself, or, as [Stallman puts it](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/) "we use copyright to guarantee their freedom." A copyleft license doesn't abandon copyright (i.e. by simply putting a work in the public domain), it asserts it and uses it.

Bazaar Dev Model

The WordPress project follows a bazaar development model along the lines described by Eric S. Raymond in his work _[The Cathedral and the Bazaar](http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/)_: "release early and often, delegate everything you can, be open to the point of promiscuity." The process, however, has required endless tweaking and refinement - there have been periods in the project in which the coding environment has felt like the Wild West, other times of greater hierarchy, times that the project has stalled around issues, and times that development has been rapid.	


With b2 spawning multiple forks, the successor to b2 remained unclear. But on May 23rd 2003, Michel, still jobless, [announced](http://www.cafelog.com/index.php?p=500&c=1) that once WordPress was launched, it would become the official branch of b2\.
One of the first means by which the developers communicated was using an IRC chat room. WordPress also has a number of IRC chat rooms on [freenode](https://freenode.net/), a network that facilitates discussion for FOSS communities. b2/Cafelog had a channel so it made sense for WordPress to have one too. The first of these was #wordpress.	

An IRC channel provides a place where people can instantaneously communicate with one another. It's also possible to log an IRC channel so that a record of what happened can be posted online.	

In the early days of WordPress, many community members would spend all day hanging out in the IRC chat room. For some, it was the tone of the IRC chat room that got them more actively involved in the WordPress community. Owen Winkler recalls:	

> I had stumbled on IRC channels for other programs before, and you know, you ask a question and no one answers or they make fun of you. WordPress was never like that. When I started out, if you came to the channel and you asked a question, people answered the question. After you learned a bit, if you stuck around, you would answer the questions too.	

It was this camaraderie that caused many people in the community to stick around. They were all learning how to write code and make software, and they were doing it together. Over time, WordPress has spawned more IRC chat rooms. The #wordpress IRC chat room is used more as a tool for user support, though there is a small community of regulars that frequent it. The #wordpress-dev channel is the place where WordPress development takes place, including weekly meetings and development chats. There are also individual chat rooms for the teams that work on different areas of the project.	

The support forums are important communication channel for the project. Originally Matt set up the support forums using miniBB, a simple, fast piece of forum software. As the number of people on the support forums grew, the software was unable to handle the increased load. But then in 2004, while stuck in San Francisco over Christmas, he took what he'd learned from WordPress and applied it to forum software, writing bbPress. Now, bbPress is a plugin, but when it was originally coded it was a standalone piece of software with its own templating system. [Matt wrote in the launch post](http://ma.tt/2004/12/bbpress/) that it was intended to "bring some weblog and WordPress sensibilities to forum software."	
				
Today, the WordPress forums are mostly used for providing support to users and developers, but back when they were first set up they were the primary mode through which the community communicated. The [first post on the forums](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/beta-test?replies=12) appeared before WordPress was even released, with a request to beta test the software. Those involved in the thread were the first to sign up for the forums, involved with the project at its very inception.	

The support forums were used to talk about everything related to WordPress: [the WordPress.org website](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/wordpressorg-feedback?replies=19), [bug reports](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/textile-breaks-when-editing-posts?replies=3), [troubleshooting](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/weird-message?replies=3), [request for design feedback](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/critisism-of-my-new-design?replies=4). It was also a place for people to [post their hacks](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/wiki-links-hack?replies=4) and later their plugins. 	
On May 27th 2003, [the first version of WordPress, WordPress 0.7, was released](http://wordpress.org/news/2003/05/wordpress-now-available/). Users who switched from b2 to WordPress would find some new features, most notably the new, simplified administration panel and the WordPress Links Manager, which allowed users to create a blogroll. With the focus on the user experience the developers tried to remove any barrier between writing content and publishing it on the web. At the time, the website WordPress produced was standards compliant, brought up to date with XHTML 1.1 --- ensuring a semantic, forward-compatible website that would work in any browser.

WordPress' launch sparked immediate project growth.
Dougal:

On May 29th, 2003 [Matt emailed Donncha](http://ocaoimh.ie/2003/05/29/b2-updates-referer-spamming-b2-and-wordpress/) to ask if he would consider merging b2++ with WordPress. Donncha agreed, raising the number of official WordPress developers to three. Matt also reached out to Francois Planque to join the project and rewrite his b2evolution improvements for WordPress. Francois considered it but felt that "[it was too much work for too little benefit](http://b2evolution.net/about/evolutionofb2.html)."

Alex:

Alex King, a Denver-based UX/UI designer and front-end developer, wrote about [upgrading from b2 0.6 to either WordPress 0.7 or b2++](http://alexking.org/blog/2003/05/27/b2-wordpress-and-b2). Installing WordPress didn't offer any significant speed improvements, while b2++ gave him a site that he couldn't log into. In the end, he decided to wait until the next version of WordPress to upgrade. [Matt responded, noting](http://alexking.org/blog/2003/05/27/b2-wordpress-and-b2#comment-199) that there would be significant improvements to database speed later, announced in WordPress 0.71's release as a 300% performance boost: "We're not kidding," the announcement post reads, "this release will perform about three times (or more) faster than previous releases of WordPress and b2." It wasn't, however, [fast enough to convince Alex to upgrade](http://alexking.org/blog/2003/06/10/wordpress-71).

Over the year, Dougal Campbell, [dougal](http://profiles.wordpress.org/dougal) and Alex King joined the team. Dougal had started blogging on September 11th 2001\. [He started a blog](http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2001/09/11/morning-of-terror/) after terrorist attacks destroyed the World Trade Centers. "I don't know if it's possible," he wrote on that day, "to express the soul-wrenching horror that I feel over the events that have occurred this morning."

At the time, Dougal wasn't a b2 user, though he had investigated using b2 for his blog. In November 2002, he posted [about writing his own blogging software](http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2002/11/12/software-development/), which he called dBlog. Dougal wanted a number of key features in in his blogging software, including security, connectivity to other blogging platforms, and content separated from presentation. Finally, Dougal wanted configurability --- dBlog would have a rich API enabling developers to extend it.

Ryan

In late 2003, another key developer joined the community. Ryan Boren, [ryan](http://profiles.wordpress.org/ryan), was a developer at Cisco Systems. He had contributed to open source projects like Gnome and the Linux kernel and was a big advocate of open source software: "I've never run Windows in my life," he says. Ryan had been blogging for a number of years, and wrote [his first blog post in September 2000](http://ryan.boren.me/2000/09/16/people-pics/). His earliest blog posts were on Blogger then Greymatter until he decided that he "wanted something new and a little nicer." He liked WordPress' markup and CSS so he made the switch, writing a Greymatter importer to move his content to WordPress.

Almost straight away, Ryan contributed to WordPress. He submitted patches to Matt, until "Matt gave me commit \[access\] because he couldn't keep up." He had little experience with PHP, but became one of WordPress' most prolific contributors, and remains a cornerstone of WordPress development to this day. Much of his work on the project has had a big influence on the WordPress ecosystem: one of these contributions was WordPress' [plugin system](http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/1008).

When b2 was first forked and WordPress created, Matt got in touch with people who had been involved with b2 or shown an interest in the new software. All of the developers were able to commit code to the repository, working on their own pet features or fixing bugs. This lasted until February 2005 when a change in tools caused a change in the development process.


Three weeks after Matt set up the repository, Mike made his first commit, repopulating files that were missing from the branch. The first functionality Matt added to WordPress was WP-Texturize, a tool he created to make text more typographically correct. Mike's first feature was excerpt functionality which allowed users to display handcrafted post summaries in RSS feeds and in other places.

Over the coming months, Mike and Matt made over 100 commits to the WordPress repository. Notable commits included WordPress' branding, Mike's b2links hack, which remained in WordPress until it was no longer turned on by default in WordPress 3.5 (released in 2012), major changes to the administration panel, and installation process improvements. Creating a simple installation process was something that both the developers felt strongly about. Both had experience of Movable Type, and like many others hadn't found the process straightforward. It was important for WordPress to create as low a barrier to entry as possible. Anyone should be able to get on the web and publish their content. Matt replaced the [`b2install.php`](http://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/wp-admin/b2install.php?rev=38) file with a new [`wp-install.php`](http://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/wp-admin/wp-install.php?rev=45) file. The aim was to keep configuration to a minimum. In its first version, the user had to create a MySQL database, add the configuration details to `b2config.php`, transfer the files to their server using FTP, and then run the script.The "famous five-minute install" was refined over time as the developers tried to make it as easy as possible to get WordPress installed.	

When Matt emailed Dougal to join WordPress development, Dougal was too busy with work to help out, and didn't want to commit only to let the other developers down. Matt suggested he contribute ideas, which led to writing code, and in September 2003 --- two years after starting his own blog --- Dougal made his first commit to WordPress. As with the other developers, his first commits were small, iterative steps. He added definition lists to the `wpautop()` function that changes double line breaks into HTML paragraph tags. Many of his early contributions to WordPress were RSS enhancements. At the time, people would check their RSS feed over and over again and it would regenerate just like a pageview. This could increase the load on the server, slowing the site down. Web discussions proposed that a HTTP 304 response could be the fix: the server could determine if there was a cached version at the local end, and if nothing had changed, it would display the cached version. Dougal used this fix to improve WordPress' RSS capabilities.

At the same time, Alex King started making commits. Alex started blogging in October 2002, [using b2](http://alexking.org/blog/2002/10/11/technical-details). With a background in User Interface and User Experience, Alex had only minimal experience with PHP. Using b2 let him develop his skills with a supportive community around him. He particularly recalls Mike Little helping him to refine and improve his code. When b2 ceased development, Alex kept watch on the forks. Despite finding WordPress too slow at first, he maintained communication with Matt and in July 2003, Alex announced that he would [help Matt launch a hacks section](http://alexking.org/blog/2003/07/23/wordpress-hacks) on [WordPress.org](http://WordPress.org).

In August 2003, Alex officially became a WordPress contributing developer. His first project was checking in a cursor-aware quicktag code. This enabled users to highlight a word in the text editor and use a hotkey to surround the text with HTML tags. In the end, the hacks section on WordPress.org was never built, as hacks were superseded by the plugin system.

In the early days, WordPress developed organically. The core developers identified new features and bug fixes, and committed code when they wished. Most developers focused on the aspects of web development that they already had an interest or a background in. Matt focused on semantics and usability --- it was important to him to remove any barrier between writing and publishing. Mike improved his b2 links plugin. He also introduced [`wp-config-sample.php`](http://wordpress.org/news/2003/06/huge-changes-in-cvs/). At the time, all b2 and WordPress configuration information was stored in b2config.php. This meant that an [upgrading user had to store the file and information safely](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/how-to-upgrade-from-71-to-72). If they overwrote it, their configuration information would be lost, and they'd end up on the support forums looking for help. Including `wp-config-sample.php` meant that there was no `wp-config.php` file bundled with WordPress --- the user renamed the file `wp-config.php`, protecting it from being overwritten. This configuration file protection was something Mike had done for previous clients, and while he recalls now that it seems like an obvious thing to do, it solved a problem that users had encountered repeatedly. Dougal worked on the [XML-RPC](http://xmlrpc.scripting.com/default.html) layer, which at that time supported Blogger's API. XML-RPC is a remote transfer protocol, which allows for remote calls via HTTP. This means that the user can post to their blog or website using a client. The Blogger API didn't cover all of the features that WordPress had. The Movable Type API and MetaWeblog API had additional features that built upon the Blogger API. Dougal added the new features so that the XML-RPC layer covered the entire feature-set of WordPress.

In late 2003, major changes to the file structure of WordPress involved replacing "b2" files with "wp-" in what Alex called [The Great Renaming](http://wordpress.org/news/2003/12/the-great-renaming/). Tidying up b2's files had been on Michel's agenda in 2001 and had made some improvements already, but they lacked consistency. When Matt finally took on the task, it caused initial problems, especially for hack writers who had used b2 filenames, but the upheaval was necessary to organize the file structure for long-term stability. WordPress' file structure morphed from b2 to the familiar WordPress file structure used today, with many files consolidated into the `wp-includes` and `wp-admin` folders.

In parallel to WordPress developments, Donncha worked on WPMU (WordPress MU). While the initial intent was to merge the b2++ codebase with the WordPress codebase, they ended up remaining separate. WPMU had its own version control system and, eventually, its own [trac](http://mu.trac.wordpress.org/). Donncha recalls that WordPress and WPMU targeted different audiences. "Most people just have one blog," says Donncha, "they don't have half-a-dozen blogs running on one server so multiple sites wouldn't have been a requirement for most people." While this situation changed as it became easier and cheaper for people to host their blogs, in 2003 it didn't make sense to have multi-user functionality available to every WordPress user. Instead, Donncha worked on WPMU alongside WordPress, and merged the changes from WordPress into WPMU. When a new version of WordPress was released, Donncha had to merge each file individually into WPMU. He used [Vimdiff](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/diff.html) to load the two files side by side. He could review changes and push them from one file to another. It wasn't always easy. "I had to keep track of the changes that were made in case they broke anything. So at the back of my mind I'd be thinking 'did that change I made five files back, will that affect this change?'" As WordPress got bigger and bigger the merges became more difficult to manage.

Just as Matt and Mike had started out answering questions on the b2 forums, new WordPress users got involved, answering forum questions. This allowed developers to spend more time writing code. A community of non-developers grew in parallel to the development community. People tried WordPress, liked it, and wanted to get involved. The project's user-centric nature meant there was work for people from a variety of backgrounds: anyone could answer support forum questions, or get involved with IRC discussions. Craig Hartel, [nuclearmoose](http://profiles.wordpress.org/nuclearmoose/), was one early community member who signed up at [WordPress.org](http://WordPress.org) in November 2003\. He was interested in blogging and had a little bit of programming experience. "I didn't have any specific skills," he says "but there was no better way than jumping right in. I decided I was going to find some way to get involved." He got to know people by asking thoughtful questions and letting people know that he was interested in helping. Craig hung out on the IRC channel until he "realized that getting involved was a matter of just doing something."

Not long after WordPress was launched, blogs starting cropping up dedicated to to the platform. The first of these was WeblogToolsCollection (WLTC), a blog initially launched by Mark Ghosh to cover every type of weblog tool but that quickly became focused almost solely on WordPress. It was followed by Carthik Sharma's [Wordlog](http://wordlog.com) and Lorelle van Fossen's [Lorelle on WordPress](http://lorelle.wordpress.com). As the community grew, more and more of these blogs sprang up. Some focused on tutorials, sharing guides on how to do things with WordPress, others created lists of plugins and themes that would draw large amounts of traffic.	

These sites provided places for people to congregate outside of the official channels. WP-Hackers was dominated by developers and could be a daunting place for those not already in the developer circle, the support forums were for support, and Trac was for development. The comments sections of WordPress community blogs often have comment threads running into the hundreds, particularly in the heyday of discussions about trademarks, GPL, and all of the other issues that caused feelings to run high.
Along with a few others, Craig pushed for WordPress documentation. As the community grew, more people asked questions on the support forums. Documentation was needed to support the users. In [December 2003 Matt, at the behest of WordPress community members, launched the WordPress Wiki](http://wordpress.org/news/2003/12/wordpress-wiki/). Originally, the wiki was designed to complement the [official documentation](http://web.archive.org/web/20030811221523/http://wordpress.org/docs/). The [landing page told visitors](http://web.archive.org/web/20031224140754/http://wiki.wordpress.org/) that it was "designed for us to be able to work together on projects." While little work was done on the official docs, the wiki grew, perhaps because the wiki felt like a much more informal, freeform way to create documents. The official support documents, such as a guide to template tags, hacking, and using WordPress, were much more formal. In a post on WordPress.org, Cena Mayo, [cena](http://profiles.wordpress.org/cena/), who had taken on the [role of reporting on the WordPress.org blog](http://wordpress.org/news/2004/03/a-brief-introduction/), outlined [some of the issues](http://wordpress.org/news/2004/04/state-of-the-docs-address/):

> "Part of the problem is the rapidly changing face of WordPress itself. The CVS is currently at version 1.2-alpha, with almost daily updates. 1.2, which will be the next official release, is much different from the widely used 1.0.1/1.02 series, and even more different from the still-used .72."

With file structures changing, new functionality appearing, new template tags, and new database tables, writing formal documentation must have seemed like a pointless task when the writer knew that things would change quickly. Over time, the wiki grew, with more and more people contributing to it. By July 2004, it was the main documentation for WordPress, and it needed a name. In WordPress' IRC chat room, [monkinetic](http://wordpress.org/support/profile/monkinetic) suggested "Codex" and in an email to the mailing list, Matt adopted it, saying it was "short, sweet, and we can totally own that word on Google."

Design was another area of growth. Before WordPress' theme system, users had to apply a new CSS stylesheet to change the look of their blog. To enable users to quickly change their blog's design, Alex King wrote a [CSS Style Switcher](http://alexking.org/blog/2004/01/20/wordpress-css-style-switcher) hack. This came with three CSS stylesheets. To grow the number of stylesheets available, Alex ran a WordPress [CSS Style competition](http://alexking.org/blog/2004/01/25/wordpress-css-style-competition). Prizes, donated by members of the community, were offered for the top three stylesheets; $70, $35, and $10\. The competition created a considerable buzz around WordPress. In total, Alex received 38 submissions, increasing the number of stylesheets available for WordPress from seven to 45\. He was also able to create a WordPress analogue to the popular [CSS Zen Garden](http://csszengarden.com) --- a [style browser for looking through all of the different stylesheets](http://alexking.org/projects/wordpress/styles/sample.php?wpstyle=pink_lilies). The competition was a success, and [Alex ran it again in 2005](http://alexking.org/blog/2005/02/27/wordpress-theme-competition), this time receiving more than a hundred submissions.

As the software developed, so did the community around it. Matt launched [WordPress.org](http://WordPress.org), in April, 2003\. It included a development blog, some schematic documentation, and support forums. The [original WordPress homepage](http://web.archive.org/web/20030618021947/http://wordpress.org/) told the world that "WordPress is a semantic personal publishing platform with a focus on aesthetics, web standards, and usability." The site gave the WordPress community a home.
Matt considered using Smarty for templating in WordPress. In April 2003, [he wrote about Smarty and SmartTemplate on the](http://wordpress.org/news/2003/04/smarty-and-smarttemplate/) [WordPress.org](http://WordPress.org) [development blog](http://wordpress.org/news/2003/04/smarty-and-smarttemplate/). Matt dismissed SmartTemplate, saying, "the syntax is so painful I wouldn't want to subject it on anyone." Smarty, on the other hand, "becomes more and more complicated with each release." With a commitment to keeping things simple, neither seemed like the ideal option for WordPress. After [researching templating systems](http://wordpress.org/news/2003/04/template-engines-uncut/), Matt settled on Smarty and Donncha's first commit to WordPress, in November 2003, was an [initial Smarty Templating system import](http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/530). It wouldn't be until [WordPress 1.5](http://wordpress.org/news/2005/02/strayhorn/) that a theme system would be released. In the end, the developers decided to create their own templating system. [Smarty was too complicated](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/smarty-the-templating-system-that-came-from-hell?replies=6#post-22474) and the developers wanted to keep templating as simple as WordPress itself.

WordPress 1.5 saw the introduction of the theme system. Gone were the days of designing your WordPress blog with just a CSS file. The new PHP template tag system gave designers much more flexibility. [Other templating systems were considered](http://wordpress.org/news/2003/04/template-engines-uncut/) and Donnacha even [imported the Smarty templating system](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/530), but in the end it was a custom WordPress system that won out.

Using a PHP template tag system had the advantage of being fast and easy, particularly for WordPress developers and designers who were learning about PHP. It was "cheap and easy, and well-known and portable," says Ryan. The theme system broke a theme down into its component parts - header, footer, sidebar, for example - theme designers could customize each of the component parts and then use template tags to call different elements to display on the front end. This gave designers a flexible templating system without having to learn something new, such as Smarty.

When WordPress 1.5 was released, it finally gave people a way to easily customize the design of their WordPress website. Many designers loved it, though the road to releasing 1.5 wasn't always smooth. 

Controversy started even before the release of the theme system. Some members of the community fumed over the decision to use an [adapted version of Michael Heilemann's Kubrick theme](https://web.archive.org/web/20041016090654/http://binarybonsai.com/archives/2004/08/22/kubrick-vs-wordpress/) as the default theme.

<img alt="Kubrick Theme" src="../../Resources/images/themes/kubrick.jpg" />

A complaint, for example, was that Kubrick contained images. This meant that a user would have to use an external image editor to make changes. Other complaints were that it was too complex, it had .htaccess issues, and that there were other (better) themes that could be chosen. The [thread on the forums] (https://wordpress.org/support/topic/why-using-kubrick-on-13-is-a-mistake) reaches five pages with flames thrown all over the place. On his blog, [Matt tried to explain](http://ma.tt/2004/08/trouble/) that Kubrick itself wasn't being bundled with WordPress, but that the design for Kubrick would be used as the basis for the new default theme.  

That brief outbreak of anger around the inclusion of Kubrick died down and Kubrick became the default theme for WordPress for many years. It was just a small taste of the controversy that would surround themes. Throughout WordPress' history, themes have been divisive, moreso than plugins. WordPress users, web users, have always been concerned with how their websites look. Everyone wants the latest and greatest design, wants to be ahead of the latest design trend. As WordPress became more popular, many of the bloggers started to build their own themes and would come to realise that they could make some money from them. Unlike the PHP developers who came to the project, these bloggers and designers didn't come from a culture of sharing. While developers are used to sharing code and distributing it with open source licenses, the same doesn't hold for designers. It was on his fault line that theme sellers clashed with the WordPress project. 

Developers, however wanted a mailing list. This was one of the most important communication tools in a FOSS project and WordPress lacked one. It took more than a year for WordPress' developer infrastructure to be set up. The [FAQ on WordPress.org reflects the approach to development at the time](https://web.archive.org/web/20040402000122/http://wordpress.org/docs/faq/):	
> _I am a programmer/designer/hacker -- can I help with the development of WP?_	
> Sure you can! Post your suggestions and requests for features in the forums. Design or alter some hacks to add functionality to the WP suite of tools. Got some cool ideas on an innovative design? By all means, build it and show it off! If you want to be directly involved in the daily development of WP, the best way is to show your competence by building clean hacks or patches that conform to the developer guidelines. Once you have some code out there, contact Matt and he'll talk to you about getting you involved more directly with development.	

The support forum [failed to provide the proper infrastructure that developers were used to on FOSS projects](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/development-culture-at-wp?replies=21). [Ryan Boren, who had experience of Linux development, posted to that thread](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/development-culture-at-wp?replies=21#post-7523: 	

> Communities are built around development mailing lists. That's where the bazaar really takes place. A BB [bulletin board] isn't nearly as good for sending and reviewing patches, performing UI reviews, and so forth. The BB is a nice resource that has its purpose, but a mailing list is better suited to development traffic. I would much rather use my favorite email client with its editing, sorting, and filtering capabilities than any web BB. Plus, the mail comes to me, not me to it.	
> Right now, I send all of my patches directly to Matt. I hope he gets them. If there was a development mailer, I would send the patches there so all interested parties could give them a look and see what people are working on.	

Matt responded in the thread to say that there was a mailing list, but that it was a private one in which he, Mike, and the other original developers communicated on. At that time, he wasn't prepared to create a public mailing list, preferring to direct all development discussion to the WordPress forums.	

That discussion thread also contains the seed of what would increasingly become a point of contention for some in the WordPress community - the division between non-technical community members and developers. A developer mailing list would segregate the community into different groups. "it's exactly the mentality that causes most OS projects to become these developer-heavy, 'in-the-know' kind of places that make them unpleasant (and unapproachable) for the average user," [wrote Cena](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/development-culture-at-wp?replies=21#post-7536). 	

By May 2004, a small, enthusiastic community had grown around WordPress. It was composed of developers who built the software, bloggers, volunteers who answered support forum queries and wrote documentation, and a growing number of international users who started to translate WordPress. The [release of WordPress 1.2](http://wordpress.org/news/2004/05/heres-the-beef/) in May 2004 brought major improvements in flexibility. The new plugin system meant that developers could create their own functionality that could plug in to WordPress without having to create hacks, and WordPress was internationalized, making it considerably easier for people to translate WordPress. And yet while WordPress use steadily increased, it was a catalyst from outside the community propelled that growth exponentially.

In early 2004, the most popular self-hosted blogging platform was Movable Type. The blogcensus.net service recorded Movable Type of holding around [70% of the market share for self-hosted blog platforms](http://web.archive.org/web/20040202101816/http://blogcensus.net/?page=tools) in February 2004\. It was used all over the world, by everyone from individual bloggers to big media outlets.

On May 13th 2004, Six Apart, the company behind Movable Type, [announced that it would change its licensing](http://web.archive.org/web/20040605225637/http://www.sixapart.com/corner/archives/2004/05/movable_type_de.shtml). Movable Type 3.0, the newest version, came with licensing restrictions which meant that users had to not only pay for the software but pay for each additional install of the software that they created. With Movable Type users frustrated and upset by Six Apart's actions, WordPress community members stepped up to help Movable Type users migrate to WordPress. [Downloads of WordPress from Sourceforge more than doubled](http://sourceforge.net/projects/cafelog/files/WordPress/stats/timeline?dates=2003-04-01+to+2005-04-01), increasing from 8,670 in April 2004 to 19,400 in May.

The Movable Type licensing change threw into relief who held the power in the relationship between developer and user. At any time, Six Apart could increase prices, change its licensing, and change the rules for its users. The license protected the developers. WordPress, on the other hand, had a license that protected its users, and it was to this user-focused, user-driven community, that Movable Type users flocked. It was the first of many times that WordPress' license, the GPL, would ignite the community, and its positive effects saw WordPress go from a small fork of b2 to a major competitor as a standalone blogging platform.

Six Apart had encountered an entirely new phenomenon: a furore surrounding their platform in which everyone had a platform to complain. Dash says:

> Nobody had ever had an audience where by definition every single one of your customers had a blog before. And so nobody had ever had a social media shit storm before. And now we can see... you can see a fast food company makes a stupid tweet, and they have like a checklist. They're like, oh, okay, we fired the intern, we're sorry, it won't happen again, here's the hashtag for how we're going to apologize, we made a donation... like you just run through the list. It doesn't even get attention unless it's something really egregious. But it hadn't happened before. And mostly because nobody else had a lot of customers that were bloggers before. So you might have one. But every single person we'd ever had as a customer was a blogger. 


Freedom Zero

One of the most coherent and thought out posts was written by Mark Pilgrim, a programmer and writer well-respected in web logging circles. In his post, titled [Freedom Zero](http://web.archive.org/web/20070911032533/http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/05/14/freedom-0), Pilgrim reminds his readers that while Movable Type had been "free" (as in free from cost), it wasn't free according to the [definition of the Free Software Foundation](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) (free as in freedom, not as in beer), and while the source code might be available, it wasn't open source [as defined by the Open Source Initiative](http://opensource.org/docs/definition.php). He described Movable Type as having been "free enough"; developers could hack on the code and add features, and while they couldn't redistribute their modifications, they could share patches, so everyone was happy enough. 

Pilgrim reflects the dissatisfaction felt by people who watched as Movable Type 2.6 fell behind in the technology while Six Apart focused on growing TypePad. He, and others, waited for Movable Type 3.0 to appear, only to discover that the new features were lacking and, worse, there was a new licensing plan so that "free enough" no longer meant free in any sense.

To continue to run his sites, Pilgrim would have to pay $535. Instead of paying that money to Six Apart, he donated it to WordPress. He wrote:

> Freedom 0 is the freedom to run the program, for any purpose. WordPress gives me that freedom; Movable Type does not. It never really did, but it was free enough so we all looked the other way, myself included. But Movable Type 3.0 changes the rules, and prices me right out of the market. I do not have the freedom to run the program for any purpose; I only have the limited set of freedoms that Six Apart chooses to bestow upon me, and every new version seems to bestow fewer and fewer freedoms. With Movable Type 2.6, I was allowed to run 11 sites. In 3.0, that right will cost me $535.

> WordPress is Free Software. Its rules will never change. In the event that the WordPress community disbands and development stops, a new community can form around the orphaned code. It's happened once already. In the extremely unlikely event that every single contributor (including every contributor to the original b2) agrees to relicense the code under a more restrictive license, I can still fork the current GPL-licensed code and start a new community around it. There is always a path forward. There are no dead ends.

> Movable Type is a dead end. In the long run, the utility of all non-Free software approaches zero. All non-Free software is a dead end.

> This site now runs WordPress. 

Pilgrim's post was an instigator in the exodus to WordPress. Even if users were willing to pay for their websites, who was to say that Six Apart wouldn't change their licensing terms again? How much would Movable 4.0 cost? How many sites would they be able to run? It was too easy for Six Apart to change the rules of the game, but with WordPress, and its GPL license, those rules could never change.

Community reaction

Six Apart's error galvanised the WordPress community. This was their opportunity to grow the platform. All of those dissatisfied Movable Type users were in need of a blogging platform that was flexible and without restrictions. Mark Pilgrim pointed them in the right direction, and the WordPress community was only too happy to help people migrate. The IRC chat rooms were buzzing. Craig Hartel recalls now that "we saw an opportunity to bring people who were passionate about something to our passion for WordPress. Maybe they would find WordPress to be as good, if not better than Movable Type. [...] We spent a lot of time on the forums and directly with people to show that we were a stronger community, that we weren't the kind of community that was just going to slap some information out there and then you were on your own."

For weeks, everyone worked hard. Developers wrote scripts to allow people to easily migrate from Movable Type to WordPress. Writers wrote [guides to migrating from Movable Type to WordPress](http://carthik.net/blog/vault/2004/05/14/movabletype-to-wordpress/). On the WordPress.org blog, [Matt posted briefly](http://wordpress.org/news/2004/05/new-pricing-scheme/) about Six Apart's licensing scheme, reminding users that the GPL "ensures that the full source is available free of charge, legally." And [WordPress had its first mention on Slashdot](http://developers.slashdot.org/story/04/05/14/1314256/bloggers-assail-movable-types-new-pricing-scheme), where it was discussed as an open source alternative to Movable Type. 

The WordPress community actively sought out people who were dissatisfied with Movable Type and suggested that they move to WordPress. Anil remembers that "I was responding in the comments on every single blog post that had complained and saw on every single blog post Matt going in and saying you should try WordPress. And I was livid."

People switching:

Pilgrim was one of many prominent people who moved from Movable Type to WordPress. Another significant adopter was [Molly E. Holzschlag](http://www.molly.com/). Along with [Porter Glendinning](http://www.g9g.org/), Molly had written a book about Movable Type, "Teach Yourself Movable Type in 24 Hours." The book was released the same week that Six Apart released Movable Type 3.0 and changed their licenses. Despite having a good relationship with the company, no one at Six Apart communicated any of the changes to the authors which meant that the book was already in danger of being out of date the week that it was published. [Molly wrote on her blog](http://web.archive.org/web/20040803105545/http://www.molly.com/2004/07/06/of-wordpress-movable-type-and-a-book/) "to find myself totally left out of the loop both as an advocate and user of the product kinda felt sucky." However, she did have a way out; she'd formed a friendship with Matt, who was more than happy to help her move. He wrote on his blog about [http://ma.tt/2004/07/mollycom-switches/](the difficulty of moving her blog). "Her switch was quite an adventure," he wrote. "Getting the data out of a partially-corrupted Berkeley database into something either MT or WordPress could parse really was a challenge." The migration was completed though, and Molly wrote that it was very much a public endorsement of WordPress, adding the caveat that there were some sites she still thought Movable Type the right tool for.

Not everyone moved purely because of the licensing changes. Others were frustrated by Movable Type's functionality. For Om Malik, [Movable Type 3.0 was simply too buggy](http://gigaom.com/2004/05/29/the-word-press-switch/). He had to deal with server errors and the worry that he wouldn't be able to post to his blog. He was helped in his switch by Pankaj Kumar, who had also produced the first Hindi translation of WordPress. Panjak [outlined Om's move to the platform](http://pnarula.com/2004/om-switch/) which went on a circuitous route via Expression Engine, WordPress 1.0.2, TypePad, Blogger, Movable Type 3.0, and then to WordPress 1.2. 

Ryan's other major early contribution was around internationalization. From its very beginning, the WordPress community was marked by its international nature. The original developers were from the USA, the United Kingdom, Ireland, and France, and a [forum thread from January 2004 shows how international the growing community was](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/world-domination-?replies=43). Community members came from Hong Kong, Wales, New Zealand, Japan, and Brazil. With people from all over the world using WordPress, platform translations soon followed. The [Japanese WordPress site was set up in December 2003](http://web.archive.org/web/20031205101812/http://wordpress.xwd.jp/), only six months after WordPress launched. As WordPress wasn't yet set up for localization, [Otsukare](http://profiles.wordpress.org/otsukare), a community member from Japan, [wrote a multilingual hack](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/localization-help-needed?replies=102) that enabled users to create multilingual versions of WordPress. Translators used the [WordPress wiki](http://web.archive.org/web/20040513021733/http://wiki.wordpress.org/index.php/fr.po) to host the translations and the multilingual hack pulled them into the remote WordPress admin.

When it came to internationalizing WordPress, however, they decided to take a different approach: `gettext()`. This method involved marking up the translatable strings with the `gettext()` [function](http://codex.wordpress.org/Translating_WordPress#Localization_Technology) so that a `.pot` file could be created with all of the strings for translation. Translators could translate the strings and generate `.po` and `.mo` files for localized versions of WordPress. To internationalize WordPress, someone had to wrap all of the translatable strings with the `gettext()` function and put them in a format that provided a full string to the translator that retained context. This job fell to Ryan. He went through the code, one line at a time, found everything that could be translated, and marked it up. This meant that when WordPress 1.2 was released, it not only contained the plugin API but was fully internationalized.

On May 19th 2004, Matt wrote about the [first full localization](http://ma.tt/2004/05/wordpress-in-hindi/) that he'd seen -- a localization in Hindi by Pankaj Narula, [panjak](http://wordpress.org/support/profile/pankaj). This was before WordPress 1.2 was released with the first official `.pot` file (the file that contains a list of all the translatable strings). Following the release of WordPress 1.2, there was an explosion of WordPress translations, for example [French](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/localizing-wordpress-12-i18n-and-l10n/page/3?replies=69%23post-35436) and [Norwegian](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/localizing-wordpress-12-i18n-and-l10n/page/3?replies=69%23post-35436#post-56422).

Prior to the plugin system, developers created hacks to extend WordPress, a practice carried over from b2. A "hack" was a bunch of code with instructions on where to insert the code into the b2 core files. In b2, administration was carried out in a separate PHP file. The b2 user would open up a text file, `b2menutop.txt`, and add the name of the PHP file that they wished to appear in the menu. When the code ran, the new menu item would appear after the default menu items. To add a hack to the administration screens, the user needed to put the PHP file into the admin directory and add a reference to it in the text file. If the hack output was intended to appear on the website, the user needed to edit b2's `index.php` file to put it in the right place. This meant that when the user updated b2, they would have to save the text file and the index file to ensure that their changes weren't overwritten, and integrate their changes into the new files.

The new plugin system used hooks to enable developers to extend WordPress without having to mess with core files. Hooks are pieces of code placed throughout the codebase that developers can hook into to run their own code at specific points. There are two types of hooks: filters and actions. Filters were already available in b2 for developers to create hacks which changed content. Actions, which were first added to WordPress 1.2, let developers run code when events, such as posting, were carried out.

The system transformed WordPress development for both the core developers and the wider community. It meant that developers no longer had to try to persuade the core team to implement their pet feature, and the core team could focus entirely on what made sense for users. Ryan says that the plugin system enabled the core developers to implement the 80/20 rule: "Is this useful to 80% of our users? If not, try it in a plugin." Unlike hacks, which involved making edits to core files, plugins could be dropped into a directory in a user's WordPress install. Non-technical users were able to extend their blogs without having to mess around with PHP.

The first plugin was the Hello Dolly plugin. The plugin, which is still bundled with WordPress, randomly displays a lyric from the Louis Armstrong song _Hello, Dolly_ in the top right of the admin. It was intended as a guide to making plugins. The "first \[plugin\] that [actually does something useful](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/first-wp-plugin-blogtimes)" was the [blogtimes plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/blogtimes/), created by Matt, which generated bar graph image showing when posts were created over a certain period of time.

But with a growing developer base a mailing list was inevitable. Developer mailing lists are one of the primary communication tools for most FOSS projects. They provide a way for developers to communicate with each other, discussing features and changes, and are often participated in by more advanced users who either have questions about the product or who want to answer the questions of others. 	

WordPress' first mailing list wasn't the developer mailing list but the documentation mailing list, wp-docs, which was [set up in November 2003](https://web.archive.org/web/20090107221645/http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/docs/2003-November/000000.html). This mailing list was used for discussion of WordPress' documentation and wiki. It was active for 6 months before the [hackers mailing list](http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/hackers/) was set up. This was later moved to [wp-hackers](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/). Development discussion moved from the support forums and on to the mailing list, leaving the forums as a place to provide support. 	

A mailing list provides a distributed way for developers to communicate with one another from their email inbox. It enables them to ask questions about development and discuss new features. The wp-hackers mailing list exploded with activity when it was set up, busy with heated discussions about issues such as [whether comment links should be nofollow](http://plugins.lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/hackers/2005-January/003617.html) to discourage spammers, [the best way to format the date](http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/hackers/2004-August/001335.html), [how to start translating WordPress](http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/hackers/2004-December/003462.html).	

Not everyone was happy, however. As predicted in the earlier thread, the mailing list further cemented the division between those who were providing support (whether in the form of answering support tickets or writing documentation) and those writing the code. In a thread posted to wp-docs and forwarded to wp-hackers, [Podz talks of how those who are writing the code aren't prepared to help out](http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/hackers/2004-July/000962.html). 	

A longstanding component of WordPress.org has been the Codex. In December 2003, Matt launched a [wiki for WordPress' documentation](http://wordpress.org/news/2003/12/wordpress-wiki/). FOSS projects often use wikis for their documentation. The advantage to a wiki is that anyone can easily edit the content. Some wikis require a login, others can be edited by anyone. The downside to using a wiki, particularly when building a content management system, is that contributors have to learn a new tool for creating content. Another problem with a wiki is that, without careful curation, it can become messy, out-of-date, and difficult to navigate.	

The original plan for documentation was to have "official" documentation on the website, and a community-generated wiki alongside. By April 2004 some work had been carried out on the main WordPress.org site. An [FAQ had been created](https://web.archive.org/web/20040402000122/http://wordpress.org/docs/faq/), as had some [template documentation](https://web.archive.org/web/20040411104706/http://wordpress.org/docs/template/). But the [majority of documentation was being written on the wiki](https://web.archive.org/web/20040323105321/http://wiki.wordpress.org/).	

Cena wrote on the news blog [that part of the problem](http://wordpress.org/news/2004/04/state-of-the-docs-address/) was that WordPress was changing all of the time, so it was hard to write stable docs. WordPress 1.2 was wildly different from 1.0, and both differed from 0.72. WordPress 1.2 introduced the plugin system, for example, which meant that the method developers used to extend WordPress was changing.	

The WordPress Codex continued to grow, and those who tried to maintain it found it difficult to keep under control. There was [no standardised way of creating new pages](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-docs/2005-February/000007.html) and no standardisation of titles. This meant that the Codex was becoming a bric-a-brac stand of documentation.	

Not all documentation ended up on the Codex. Community members also wrote on their blog - Mark Riley's tamba2 blog, for example, was home to a number of popular tutorials. Other contributors started to post their tutorials on the support forums. Lorelle van Fossen [started posting her WordPress tutorials on the forums](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/lesson-designing-styles-for-contests) before later porting them over to the Codex.	

As the Codex grew, there were [ongoing discussions about what types of documentation to write](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-docs/2005-March/000160.html). Documentation comes in many different forms. It can be task-based, teaching a user how to do a specific thing. Or it can be reference-based, an article that someone can refer to when having trouble with a particular screen. The Codex became a repository for both, with guides for elements such as the administration screens, while Lorelle wrote a series of [WordPress Lessons](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-docs/2005-April/000480.html) to teach people how to make the most out of WordPress.	
	
After a flurry of activity on the wp-docs mailing list for its first few years, it started to die down, and some months saw [barely any posts at all](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-docs/2006-May/thread.html). The documentation continued to grow, and while there was lots of good documentation, a big problem with the Codex was its structure. [Martin Sturm posted to the wp-docs mailing list highlighting the problem](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-docs/2007-February/001436.html). Tutorials, how-tos and reference documentation were all mixed up together. The function reference was incomplete, and the plugin API only poorly documented. 
The first repository was the [WordPress Plugin Repository](http://wordpress.org/news/2005/01/the-wordpress-plugin-repository/). This was hosted at dev.wp-plugins.org, powered by trac with version control using subversion. As well as having a code repository that users and developers could browse, the wiki was used for a very early version of the Plugin Directory.	
	
<img src="../../Resources/community/plugin-directory-2005.jpg" width="800px" />

The repository, while being full of tools for developers, didn't have an easy user interface that would help users to find the plugins that they need. Trac and wikis can often be difficult for non-technical software users to navigate.
