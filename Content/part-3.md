The project [shifted from CVS to a more modern version control system, SVN](http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/hackers/2005-February/004078.html). The most active contributors at that point were Ryan and Matt, and when the move was made to SVN none of the other original developers had their commit access renewed.	

This started a long period in which WordPress development operated through a funnel. Contributors would create a patch, upload it to mosquito (and later trac), it would be reviewed by Matt or Ryan, who would then commit the code to the main repository. Over time, the funnel became smaller as Matt was busy and most of the work was being undertaken by Ryan. The advantage of having a funnel was that disagreements about code happened before it landed in the repository. The disadvantage was that one person had to review every patch, which frustrated developers who were waiting for their patches to be committed.	

The model mirrored [the Linux approach to development](https://secure.flickr.com/photos/tellyworth/877035360/in/set-72157600962530938), although they differed in the fact that Linux has only one committer - the project founder Linus Torvalds - whereas WordPress had two, and this progressively opened up to more and more committers. The other difference is that Linux has a number of maintainers who maintain different subsystems before pushing patches upstream. Although WordPress in the future would move towards component maintainers, it never followed Linux in this manner.	

This lack of obvious support for non-code contributions coupled with the dissatisfaction of some community members, was perhaps a symptom of the differing philosophies around leadership. Certainly the founding members of the Habari project had a fundamentally different philosophy on the way that a project was run. Their founding ethos came from Rich Bowen, who had, prior to WordPress, already been involved in the Apache Foundation. Unlike many free and open source projects, the Apache Foundation has dispensed with the Benevolent Dictator for Life (BDFL) model and instead has a committee that is responsible for decisions. When it comes to running an open source project, Apache, Rich says, is a meritocracy, and [WordPress is not](http://drbacchus.com/meritocracy):

> Matt claims that WordPress is a meritocracy. I disagree. WordPress has one attribute that eliminates it from that category - Matt is in charge. Please don't take this as an attack on Matt. It's not. It's a question of definitions. The fact that there is one person who has the final say makes WordPress not a meritocracy. Even if Matt always bends to the will of the people, he still has the final say. 

Matt and Rich's disagreement came down to a fundamental disagreement on how an open source project should be run. In _Homesteading the Noosphere_ Eric Raymond discusses [project structures and ownership](http://catb.org/esr/writings/homesteading/homesteading/ar01s16.html), looking at how a project structure emerges over time. The emergence of WordPress' project structure very much follows what Raymond outlines - the project has a single owner/maintainer, or in the case of WordPress it had two - Mike Little and Matt Mullenweg. Over time, Matt assumed leadership of the project. As more and more contributors were attracted to the project those that were active would be given commit access. In WordPress' case, commit access carried with it an implicit level of authority. Those with commit access are the arbiters of the code that ends up in core and the code that doesn't. Matt [made clear on a number of occasions](http://codex.wordpress.org/IRC_Meetups/2005/June/June29RawLog) that he didn't "want it to be a status thing," but this didn't prevent it from becoming so.

For some time, only Matt and Ryan Boren had commit access to WordPress, themselves constituting a funnel and checking mechanism through which all the code would run. More committers were eventually added, but it was a slow process and one that led to frustration, particularly amongst prolific contributors such as Owen Winkler and Scott Merrill. 

Coming from Apache, Bowen brought a different perspective to the project, one that chimed with the more dissatisfied developers. The Apache Project has discarded the BDFL model of open source governance and instead has a voting committee which is responsible for governance. [A discussion between Rich and Matt in a comment thread](https://neosmart.net/blog/2007/a-clarification-on-wordpress/comment-page-1/#comment-10985) makes clear their disagreement around leadership. Matt maintains that WordPress is a meritocracy because commit access is provided to "the best of the best of the best contributors who prove their worth over time with high quality code, responsiveness to the community, and reliability in crunch times." Bowen, on the other hand, challenges him by saying:

> A meritocracy is a system by which ability determines power. WordPress is a system by which the leader of the community is by definition [sic]. You, Matt, are the leader of the WordPress community. You have the power to overrule decisions, and you use that power. There are meritocratic aspects to how WordPress operates, but the fact that you exercise your right of fiat makes it not a meritocracy.

This mode of governance led to a disagreement how a FOSS project should be structured. In the WordPress project, authority followed commit access to the repository, and commit access followed high quality code submissions along with an understanding and commitment to the project ethos. Because authority naturally followed code, it meant that there was no defined leadership roles within the project for non-coders. At times, Matt did try to [emphasise that](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2005-June/001417.html) "Committing != community status. It simply is a way to ensure that all the code that goes into the core is reviewed before being distributed to the world," but this didn't prevent the feeling of disenfranchisement from people who had felt they had no clear way to be on par with the core committers. Commit access may have been given out sparingly to developers but authority and leadership was still in theory achievable to anyone who could write code. For those whose role was helping on the support forums, writing documentation, providing translations, or any of the myriad supporting activities that go on around software development, there was no formal way for those who worked hard and demonstrated a commitment to the project to be acknowledged.

In the Habari project, commit access isn't just given to people who review and commit the code, but is a symbol of trust and status within the community. In a recent interview, Owen Winkler said:

> there's some people who are committers, who are part of the primary management committee in Habari who I would never want to actually touch the code because they don't really do development. But we give them access to it because they've demonstrated that they're part of the community and they're actively trying to advance Habari as a project.

In a project in which commit access = responsibility and authority, it makes sense to give access to anyone who holds such a position within the project. However, if you're trying to create a project in which the two do not go hand-in-hand, keeping commit access as purely a checking mechanism makes sense. That said, it's not always clear to people within the project what constitutes authority and what doesn't, and having a commit access is inevitably a clear symbol of trust.

Early discussions are focused on WordPress' logo. In the early days the WordPress logo was simply "WordPress" in the dante font. 

![Original WordPress logo](../../Resources/images/design/wp-logo-old.png) 

Community members liked to riff on this original logo, creating versions for seasonal and other events:

![WordPress St Patricks Day Logo](../../Resources/images/design/wp-logo-stpatty.gif) 

![WordPress Valentines Day Logo](../../Resources/images/design/wp-logo-valentine.gif) 

![WordPress Happy Birthday Dougal Logo](../../Resources/images/design/wp-logo-happy-dougal.png) 

![WordPress Calvin Logo](../../Resources/images/design/wp-logo-calvin.gif) 

By 2005 the project was in need of a new logo, preferably one created by a designer rather than one put together by Matt.

The community was asked to make suggestions about the logo. A mixed set of results came back and Matt shared these with the wp-design group for feedback.

The [first suggestions](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-design/2005-March/000163.html) were from Andreas Kwiatkowski

![Kwiatkowski logo suggestion 1 =600x](../../Resources/images/design/2005_03_wordpress-logo-proposal_kwiatkowski_1.png) 

![Kwiatkowski logo suggestion 2](../../Resources/images/design/2005_03_wordpress-logo-proposal_kwiatkowski_2.png)

A [second batch were sent](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-design/2005-March/000171.html) by Denis Radenkovic:

![Radenkovic heart logo](../../Resources/images/design/2005_03_wordpress-logo-proposal_radenkovic_sample.jpg) 

The feedback for the logos was mostly lukewarm, though both [Joen](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-design/2005-April/000175.html) and [Michael](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-design/2005-March/000173.html) both liked Radenkovic's heart logos, describing them as "instantly recognisable" . 

Joen even submitted his own versions of the logo based on Denis Radenkovic's heart design: 

![Asmussen first design](../../Resources/images/design/2005_05_wordpress-logo-proposal_asmussen_sample.jpg) 

And he produced a version of the admin screen with the design in situ:

![Asmussen admin design](../../Resources/images/design/2005_05_wordpress-logo-proposal_asmussen_admin.jpg) 

Outside of the WordPress community other people were trying their hands at the logo. In March, Matt met [Jason Santa Maria](http://jasonsantamaria.com/) at South by South West and asked him to try redesigning the WordPress logo. They shared abstract ideas about what they thought the logo should be: "the things that kept coming up were not only the idea of publishing but the idea of having a personal journal and a personal thing that might have some sort of tactile overtones," says Jason now.  "We were making links to things like letterpress and journaling and any sort of older representations of what it meant to publish something in a physical form." In April, [Matt shared some of the early versions](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-design/2005-April/000182.html) with the wp-design group:

![Santa Maria, first logo versions](../../Resources/images/design/2005_04_wordpress-logo-proposal-santa-maria1.gif) 

They didn't go over well;  ["a little too aristocratic"](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-design/2005-April/000194.html)  was one of the comments. The designers [felt that the design by Denis Radenkovic](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-design/2005-April/000185.html) was more in line with WordPress' brand. 

More designs were posted to the group, but the responses failed to improve.

![Santa Maria, logo 2](../../Resources/images/design/2005_04_wordpress-logo-proposal-santa-maria2.gif) 

![Santa Maria, logo 3](../../Resources/images/design/2005_04_wordpress-logo-proposal-santa-maria3.gif) 

While the logo discussion continued, Khaled spoke to Matt off-list about it. Speaking to Matt helped to clarify for him the direction Matt wanted to go with the branding and feel of WordPress. He [reported back](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-design/2005-April/000192.html):

> WordPress is meant to be the Jaguar or Aston Martin of Blogging tools. [...] that line sets the stage for what the design of the branding should be. Elegance, polished, and impecably [sic] designed is where we should be aiming. 

On May 15th, Matt sent an email to the mailing list with the subject "I think this is it". It contained just one image:

![Santa Maria, final design](../../Resources/images/design/2005_04_wordpress-logo-proposal-santa-maria-final.gif) 
At the start of March 2005, there had been 50,000 downloads of WordPress 1.5, and just three weeks later the number had doubled to 100,000. To celebrate the landmark, Matt announced a [party in San Francisco](http://wordpress.org/news/2005/03/fifty-thousand/). On 22nd March, a group of WordPressers got together in the Odeon Bar in San Francisco. As with many parties in the tech industry, the booze was flowing.		

At the party was one of Matt's friends, Jonas Luster, [jluster](http://profiles.wordpress.org/jluster/). Jonas was an employee at [Collabnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CollabNet), the company behind Subversion. At the party they discussed, as they had discussed before, what a company built around a free software should look like. Matt's had an idea for an organisation called Automattic: an umbrella company that would include a number of different WordPress organisations. The first of these was WordPress Incorporated. At the party, Matt asked Jonas if he'd like to be involved. Jonas agreed.

Shortly afterwards Matt was on stage announcing the formation of WordPress Inc with Jonas Luster as employee number one. By the following morning, a [couple of blogs](http://sfist.com/2005/03/22/wordpress_incorporated.php) had [covered the announcement](http://laughingsquid.com/matt-mullenweg-announces-wordpress-inc/). A few days later, [Matt went on holiday](http://ma.tt/2005/03/wordpress-world-tour/) leaving WordPress' very first employee holding the reins.		

While the party was going on, there was a storm brewing. In February, a [user had posted on the WordPress.org support forums](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/odd-wordpress-articles?replies=6) asking about hundreds of articles hosted at wordpress.org/articles/. The articles were about everything from credit and healthcare to web hosting. The thread was closed by an unknown moderator. It was come across by blogger Andy Baio, however, who duly contacted Matt to ask him what was going on.		
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WordPress/book/master/Resources/images/commercial/wp_org_spam.png" width="800px" />

Matt provided Andy with an explanation. He was being paid by a company called Hot Nacho to host the articles on WordPress.org. He was using the money to cover the costs associated with WordPress. "The /articles thing isn't something I want to do long term," he told Andy, "but if it can help bootstrap something nice for the community, I'm willing to let it run for a little while." In addition to responding to Andy, Matt re-opened the support forum thread and [left a response](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/odd-wordpress-articles?replies=6#post-160502)		

> The content in /articles is essentially advertising by a third party that we host for a flat fee. I'm not sure if we're going to continue it much longer, but we're committed to this month at least, it was basically an experiment. However around the beginning of Feburary [sic] donations were going down as expenses were ramping up, so it seemed like a good way to cover everything. The adsense on those pages is not ours and I have no idea what they get on it, we just get a flat fee. The money is used just like donations but more specifically it's been going to the business/trademark expenses so it's not entirely out of my pocket anymore.		

On 30th March, while Matt was in Italy, Andy [published an article about it on his blog](http://waxy.org/2005/03/wordpress_websi/). The blogosphere exploded. No matter what Matt's intentions, people saw it as a shady SEO tactic. They felt that a free software project should know better than to get into bed with article spammers. Not only was WordPress.org hosting the spammy articles, CSS had been used [to cloak the articles](http://waxy.org/2005/03/wordpress_websi/#comment-18433). The fact that the articles were hidden only served to suggest that Matt knew that he was doing something wrong when he agreed to do it. If everything was above board, why not do it out in the open?		

With Matt out of town, it fell to Jonas to deal with the fallout from Andy's article. It wasn't clear where the [line between WordPress.org and WordPress Inc lay](http://waxy.org/2005/03/wordpress_websi/#comment-18519), but with Jonas was the only official-sounding person he was the one to receive the tech community's ire. While at a Technorati drink-up, someone came up to him and told him he needed to check his email. He returned to the technorati office to find his inbox full of emails asking what was going on.		

It was the first that Jonas had heard of the articles on WordPress.org. They'd been put there weeks before the WordPress Inc announcement. With Matt out of contact he spent the next few days putting out fires. He [posted on his blog asking for calm](https://web.archive.org/web/20050415082051/http://www.jluster.org/2005/03/spam-matt-wordpressorg-and-i-am-exhausted-bad-mix/), asking that Matt be given the benefit of the doubt. 		

[Some people saw it](http://www.forevergeek.com/2005/03/wordpress_making_money_the_wrong_way/) as the first move by WordPress Inc to make money, and took it as indicative that Matt and Jonas were't going to monetise WordPress in an ethical manner. Jonas did his best to emphasise that the articles had nothing to do with WordPress Inc, but since there was little clarity about what WordPress Inc actually was, it was easy for people to lump them together.		

By the next day, Andy had updated his post to report that WordPress' PageRank had dropped to 0/0, which meant that WordPress.org had been removed from Google's search engine results. 		

The WordPress and tech communities weren't the only people unhappy. Textdrive, who hosted WordPress for free on a  server along with apps such as Ruby on Rails, saw their server take a pounding from all of the hits from the links.		

The story escalated, with major tech resources picking it up ([The Register](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/03/31/cnet_weblog_keyword_scam/), [Slashdot](http://slashdot.org/story/05/03/31/196220/wordpress-banned-by-google-for-spamming), [Ars Technica](http://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2005/03/4759-2/). On March 31st, [Matt posted briefly on his blog](http://ma.tt/2005/03/back-online/) to say that he had just learned about what had happened and that he would get online to address the questions as soon as possible. The comments are littered with messages of support from [people who would later be central to the project](http://ma.tt/2005/03/back-online/#comment-18670) and even [from Matt's blog rival](http://ma.tt/2005/03/back-online/#comment-18673). He also received [support on WordPress' support forums](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/support-matt-mullweg?replies=23).		
	
On 1st April, [Matt issued a full response](http://ma.tt/2005/04/a-response/). In it, he stresses that he was struggling to find a way to support the open source project, that he felt that his options were limited:		

> To thrive as an independent project WordPress needs to be self-sufficient. There are several avenues this could go, all of which I've given a lot of thought to. One route that would be very easy to go in today's environment is to take VC funding for a few million and build a big company, fast. Another way would be to be absorbed by an already big company. I don't think either is the best route for the long-term health of the community. (None of these are hypothetical, they've all come up before.) There are a number of things the software could do to nag people for donations, but I'm very hesitant to do anything that degrades the user experience. Finally we could use the blessing and burden of the traffic to wordpress.org to create a sustainable stream of income that can fund WP activities.		

The decision to host the articles on WordPress.org was an attempt to mitigate some of the costs of the open source project. For many people, Matt's response sufficed to answer their concerns and questions. [But for others, it wasn't enough](https://web.archive.org/web/20050922005353/http://weblog.burningbird.net/archives/2005/04/01/there-is-communicationand-then-theres-not/). If a open source project had to resort to turning it's highly ranking website into a link farm, what was the future viability of that project? Weren't there other ways to support the project? Matt had been at the [web spam summit](https://ma.tt/2005/02/at-spam-summit/) in February, which had [specifically addressed](http://www.sifry.com/alerts/archives/000288.html) "comment spam, link spam, TrackBack spam, tag spam, and fake weblogs". Hadn't he, at that point, realised that there might be something dubious?		

As with most storms on the internet, when the articles were removed and Matt had issued his apology the outrage subsided. It did, however, have a lasting impact in a number of ways. It changed Matt's thinking about spam away from viewing it purely as something that is received in an email inbox, to web spam, which could quickly pollute the web. This fed into his thinking when developing Akismet, Automattic's anti-spam solution. And while Matt had learned a harsh lesson about ethical ways to make money on the web, it would return to haunt him again and again. Any time WordPress.org clamped down on search engine optimisation tactics, in themes for example, irate community member would bring up hot nacho.		

Themes lagged behind plugins in terms of an official repository. For a long time themes were hosted on themes.wordpress.net, an unofficial directory of themes. Theme developers could simply upload their theme and users could browse the directory for themes that they liked. 	

<img src="../../Resources/community/theme-viewer-2007.jpg" width="800px" />

However, the system was susceptible to spam and duplicate themes. Some theme developers tried to game the system by [downloading their theme multiple times](https://web.archive.org/web/20080415170633/http://themes.wordpress.net/blog/939/first-spammer-caught/) to appear at the top of the most popular results. And when the furore around sponsored themes erupted, the theme viewer was at the centre of the controversy.
Jonas' first few weeks at WordPress Inc got off to an explosive start, and over the next few months he would continue to do unpaid work as WordPress Inc's only employee. He got in touch with major web hosts and created partnerships so that WordPress.org could make money by recommending hosting companies. He met with venture capitalists to talk about where WordPress was going.		

At an [IRC Meetup in August 2005](https://codex.wordpress.org/IRC_Meetups/2005/August/August03RawLog), Matt discussed some of the ways he wanted to see the project supported. Rather than go down the route of fundraising, he wanted to see a company that was responsible for generating revenue and that "the goal, eventually, is for it to be the biggest contributor someday, supporting community members to work on WP full-time." Donations to the project would be kept separate from the company. This would protect the project from any of the liabilities of the company and ensure that if the company was sold the project would be safe. In this chat, it's clear that the "inc" that Matt refers to in the chat isn't WordPress Inc, but the as-yet-unannounced Automattic. When asked about the employees, he says that the only one is Donncha, with Ryan Boren planned for the future. WordPress Inc itself fizzled out, disappearing with much less fanfare than it arrived. There wasn't money available in WordPress Inc to pay Jonas a salary, especially when Matt was using his own salary from his job at CNET to pay Donncha to work on WordPress.com.		

The wider community was [confused about what had happened with WordPress Inc](https://web.archive.org/web/20110816084138/http://www.airbagindustries.com/archives/008169.php), especially those who had watched Matt on stage announcing the launch of the company. In response, Matt [posted a page on the WordPress Codex](https://codex.wordpress.org/User:Matt/WordPress_Inc_Story), trying to explain what had happened:		

> At the WordPress 100k party in March 2005, I talked about the formation of a "WordPress Inc." with Jonas Luster as the first employee. That never really got off the ground, I continued my job at CNET and Jonas (who I couldn't afford to pay a salary) ended up going to work for Technorati. It wasn't even planned to be announced at the party (since it wasn't clear logistically how it would happen) but everyone was really excited about it and I had an extra G&T (or two), we all got carried away.		

For example, in June 2005, the [bug gardening scheme was started](http://codex.wordpress.org/IRC_Meetups/2005/June/June29RawLog). Mark, Scott, and another user were given maximum privileges in trac and were assigned the task of bug gardening. Change was slow and the developers became more and more disenfranchised, but change was happening. Mark Jaquith recalls "I felt like [...] Matt was right on the verge of loosening the reins, it felt like things were really starting to get good and they left. And I was like oh, if you'd just held on." 

A hosted service like WordPress.com needed to have a business behind it to pay for server costs, run the software, provide support, and build new features. The free software project, with its haphazard donations and income from hosting companies, couldn't maintain a such a network on a wide-scale.		

Creating a user-focused business made sense in the context of the WordPress project. WordPress had always been committed to users, sometimes to the detriment of developers. It has always had laypeople at its heart, people who don't necessarily know the mechanics of how a server worked but who a website.		

Automattic could have gone down the same track as Red Hat, providing enterprise versions of WordPress, but the team only had to look at their predecessors, Six Apart, to judge whether pursuing enterprise customers would keep their core values or not.		

WordPress.com was intended for people who wanted to just fill out a form and have a blog, but still have the power of WordPress. This meant that WordPress.com was a balancing act. There would always be people who wanted it simpler, with less functionality, and there would always be people who wanted it more like the WordPress software, with plugins. The team had to strike a middle ground, a place for people who didn't want to set up WordPress but who wanted to blog.		
Invites to [WordPress.com opened in August 2005](http://matt.wordpress.com/2005/08/15/invites/). Every person who signed up got one invite to pass along. Invites were much in demand, with one finding its way on to ebay.		

If people wanted to get their hands on WordPress.com but didn't want to wait for an invite, they could download the Flock browser. Flock was a social-media focused browser that had social networking built in to its interface. Both of these measures - invites and Flock - allowed WordPress.com to grow in a slow and sustainable way. Putting a barrier in the way of new sign-ups helped with scalability. At the time, scaling a platform quickly wasn't easy to do, and creating barrier to signups helped to control the flow of people.		
In late 2005, as well as launching WordPress.com, [Matt launched the Akismet plugin for WordPress](http://ma.tt/2005/10/akismet-stops-spam/). Akismet (which stands for Automattic kismet) is a way of dealing with spam in aggregate, a crowd-sourced spam-fighting tool. 		

Each time a comment is posted to your website, it's submitted to Akismet and checked against all of the other comments in the database. If it's spam, it's deleted, if it's not it lands on your site. If a piece of spam gets through and a user then marks it as spam, this comment is added to the database. So the pool of spam comments is constantly widening, making Akismet into something that is more effective over time.		
	
Web spam is a big problem for bloggers. Spammers leave comments on blogs and sometimes bloggers can receive hundreds or thousands of spam comments in a short period of time. Some spam comments are designed to fool the blogger, they are written with generic flattery that an unsuspecting blogger can take for a genuine comment. The aim of these spammers is to get your blog visitors to click the link back to their site. Spamming is sometimes automated, sometimes it's done by people, and spammers are always looking for ways to get around anti-spam.		
	
Spam has always been a problem; its the old problem of unsolicited mail in your mailbox, but on a huge scale. Email spam has always been a problem but blogging created gaps all over the internet where opportunities for user-inputted data were taken advantage of by spammers. It's not just comment boxes that leave bloggers vulnerable. Technology such as trackback is susceptible to spam; Movable Type was afflicted particularly badly for a long time by trackback spam.		

Akismet ran on an honour system - it was free for individuals or non-commercial bloggers, but once you started making money you were asked to pay.		

In November 2005, Matt started a discussion on the wp-hackers mailing list [asking list members for suggestions of plugins that could be bundled with core](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2005-November/003162.html). The developers were keen to have an anti-spam solution available for WordPress users. Akismet was discussed, but [not everyone was comfortable bundling a plugin that had a commercial element to it](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2005-November/003177.html), and there were concerns about [the data that Akismet collected and how it was stored](https://codex.wordpress.org/IRC_Meetups/2005/October/October26RawLog). Besides, to use Akismet, a person needed a WordPress.com account and WordPress.com was still an invite-open service. Not everyone had an invite. For those that didn't, they could download the Flock browser but not everyone wanted to download a new browser.		

But not [everyone was against it](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2005-November/003189.html), and [Matt checked Akismet into core in mid-November](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3161#file0). When WordPress 2.0 beta came out in November 2005, it came bundled with Akismet. And WordPress users had a new weapon against spam. Two days later, [WordPress.com was open to public signups](http://ma.tt/2005/11/wordpresscom-open/). 		

The concern continued that a plugin that made money was shipped with WordPress. People felt that this gave Automattic an unfair advantage.	Discussions about whether Akismet should continue to ship with core are returned to perennially in the community, including amongst the core developers and at core team meet ups.  "It seems an unfair advantage and it cuts against WordPress' goal of openness," says Mark Jaquith, "That being said, spam is still a huge problem and Akismet is still the leading product, even though there are now alternatives." 

The open nature of the WordPress plugins makes it difficult to develop a widely-adopted anti-spam plugin. As soon as a plugin has wide-spread adoption, spammers will learn how it works and get around it. So while the team has discussed adopting a model in which a number of different anti-spam options are recommended, it isn't yet viable. "The moment we recommend five plugins," says Andrew Nacin, "the spammers will all target the other four that don't have the ability to evolve and learn like Akismet does." It's creates a challenging intersection between business and free software. Including a freemium plugin with the software doesn't gel completely with the software's openness goals, but, at the same time, taking it away could have a detrimental effect on users, which goes against the project's user-first principles. Akismet continues to be bundled with core, and the issue continues to be discussed.

In December that year, when the memory of WordPress Inc was fading, [Matt launched Automattic](http://ma.tt/2005/12/automattic-beta/), a new home for WordPress.com, Akismet, and the other products he had launched. It marked a beginning for its new employees, who now had to balance the aims of the open source project with the commercial concern of the company. . It's a balance that has affected both WordPress and Automattic throughout their close histories. 		

The intention for Automattic was to be a startup run along open source principles of distribution, openness, and collaboration. As the project grew so it would support Automattic, and Automattic could put resources back into the project.		

Automattic was launched with four employees - Donncha O'Caiomh, the original developer of WordPress MU, who was employed to start working on the infrastructure of WordPress.com earlier in June, Ryan Boren, Matt, and Andy Skelton. They all left their jobs and put their faith in WordPress being able to grow beyond an open source project to a platform that could sustain a blogging business. In the early days, there was very little money involved. Matt was paying Donncha and Andy from his CNET salary. 		

All of these problems might have been solvable. After all, the developers who went on to set up Habari all enjoyed working on WordPress, had created friendships and relationships within the community, and all felt invested in the project. For some developers, however, the founding of Automattic and the setting up of WordPress.com was one step too far. Owen Winkler recalls how, while he might have liked more modern coding techniques, that didn't drive him from the project:

> You recruit all these developers to do work on this thing and then you take that work and make a product out of it that those developers don't have any involvement in, monetarily. And it's not... it sounds a little greedy for the developers, but really, there's a lot of people who contributed to WordPress that all they got was credit. The argument is that anyone could have taken WordPress and done what Automattic did with WordPress, but no one could have done what Automattic did with WordPress because Automattic and Matt and whoever owned the trademark to the name. So you create a new project that uses WordPress, you have to call it something else, and it's not WordPress.

Some developers were asked to go to work at Automattic, the first being Donncha O'Caoimh and Ryan Boren, and Mark Riley was the first non-developer to join the team. However, many were not. This led to problems. First, there was a perception that development talent was being taken from the community and diverted into Matt's commercial venture, with particular issue being taken with the fact of WordPress.com appropriating the name "WordPress." Secondly, it created a division in the community of those who were asked to go and work at Automattic and those who weren't. The [Habari developers maintain](http://asymptomatic.net/2007/01/09/29/whats-up) that Habari wasn't simply a product of their being annoyed because they hadn't been offered jobs at Automattic. In fact, while originally some of the developers left in frustration, by the time the Habari project launched they appeared to be happier doing their own thing than they had been at WordPress.

Akismet and WordPress.com weren't the only things that caused tension in the community. People were suspicious that Automattic would take over WordPress. Would they mess it up? Would it remain a real open source project? Much of the ire of the community was directed towards Matt. As the project lead and the co-founder of Automattic, he straddled both organisations in a very public way. For the community it wasn't always clear when he was representing Automattic and when he was representing the project. When he made a decision that people were unhappy with, people felt that he was acting in his capacity as founder of Automattic, its commercial interests, and all that entailed. Even as the project became comfortable with Matt's dual-role, there were always questions about his ability to lead both. A blog post from 2009 [questioned Matt's ability to lead the project](https://web.archive.org/web/20091119030354/http://brandingdavid.com/blogging/my-thoughts-on-the-current-state-of-the-wordpress-project). In the comments, both Matt and Mark Jaquith weigh in on the comments. Matt emphasised that much of the day to day running of the project had been passed over to the other lead developers, while Mark vouched for the project lead; "He is effectively the face of WordPress -- an ambassador, if you will. He's smart, charismatic and a seasoned world-traveler -- perfect qualities for a "lead advocate" or "project visionary" type of role."		
	
Matt wasn't the only Automattic employee who community members were concerned about. As WordPress.com grew, it [looked like WordPress.org was being left to founder](http://wank.wordpress.com/2007/05/01/how-to-lose-your-soul-slightly/). Both Ryan and Matt, who were the only committers and the main developers of WordPress had this other thing that they had to look after. Both WordPress.com and WordPress 2.0 launched in December 2005, and the next major update of WordPress didn't appear until January 2007. For WordPress, that was a long delay between releases. 


The first attempt to redesign WordPress' admin was in early 2005 by a team of designers who called themselves "Shuttle". A [mailing list was set up](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-design/) where the group could communicate. The group comprised Michael Heilemann ([michael](http://profiles.wordpress.org/michael)), Khaled Abou Alfa ([khaled](http://profiles.wordpress.org/khaled)), Joen Asmussen ([joen](http://profiles.wordpress.org/joen)), Chris Davis ([chrisjdavis](http://profiles.wordpress.org/chrisjdavis)), Joshua Sigar ([alphaoide](http://profiles.wordpress.org/alphaoide)), and Matt. They were joined later on in the process by Bryan Veloso ([Syni](http://profiles.wordpress.org/syni)). The aim of the group was to create a coherent brand for WordPress with a view to redesigning the admin. 

Logo decided, the group could get back to their main purpose: to come up with a reimagined and modernised WordPress admin. The work was intended to be an aesthetic refresh, as opposed to a functional refresh, i.e. focusing on changing the design elements rather than adding any new functionality. They started work in the wake of WordPress 1.5, which came out with a set of admin screens in need of some love. 

![WordPress 1.5, Strayhorn](../../Resources/images/design/admin1_5.jpg) 

Unlike core development of WordPress, the Shuttle group carried out their work on a private mailing list. This was open to other members but the list archives weren't public. To provide feedback on Shuttle and get involved, a person had to ask if they could be added to the group, and the group had to agree on adding a new member. This highlighted one of the tensions in designing in an open source environment. A free software project by its nature is open for anyone to get involved.

Linus's Law ([as outlined by Eric Raymond](http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/homesteading/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s04.html)) says that "given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow." If there is a problem, get lots of eyes on it as it will be transparent to someone. This works when the problem in question is a bug or a coding matter with a clear answer.

Design, however, is much more subjective, and all of the designers involved with the Shuttle project felt that opening up the design process to anyone would lead to a case of "too many cooks". "A mailing list like that," recalls Chris Davis now, "would become so much noise and so little signal so quickly that there would be no way we could move forward." 

To try and avoid a scenario in which there were too many people involved, the group was kept small, with three main designers (Michael, Joen, and Khaled) and a number of coders responsible for realising the vision. The group worked from a set of PSDs and sent designs around amongst themselves, providing feedback on each other's work and iterating on the design. Much of the discussion focused on design specific elements, with Matt occasionally implementing design ideas along the way in WordPress itself. 

The focus was mainly on the Post writing screen (post.php) and over the coming year they sent 28 different versions to the mailing list. 

Version 8

As work on Shuttle progressed, community members who weren't involved with the development were frustrated that it was being carried out behind closed doors. There was no clarity about what the Shuttle group was and what they were responsible for. Some people were convinced that the Shuttle group was redesigning the admin while the rest of the community were cut out of it, whereas [Matt's view on it], on the other hand, was (http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2005-June/001417.html) "Shuttle is a few designers who throw photoshop comps back and forth to each other."

The foremost person who was irked about the process was WordPress co-founder Mike Little. In June 2005, [Matt checked in](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/2639) changes to the write screen that implemented the new pods functionality, enabling users to collapse and expand meta boxes on the screen. The changes weren't discussed ahead of time on wp-hackers or IRC, just on the closed wp-design mailing list. This precipitated a long discussion on wp-hackers about [openness in the project](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2005-June/001403.html). While Matt intended the commit to be a discussion point, it was perceived to be a wholesale change made without discussion. Many people in the community felt that discussion should have happened ahead of the commit, or that the community should have at least been informed that the user interface design had been delegated to the Shuttle group. That was, after all, how an open source project should work. The issue was discussed in the [WordPress IRC chat room](http://codex.wordpress.org/IRC_Meetups/2005/June/June29RawLog). The openness issue was seen to stem from the fact of only Matt and Ryan having commit access. All issues had to go through them. Discussions were had about how to make the process more open.  As a result both Mark Jaquith and Sean Evans (morydd) were made bug gardeners and given maximum privileges on trac. 

As the design process continued, elements of Shuttle were implemented in WordPress. One of the earliest Shuttle designs increased the size of the title field in the post.php edit screen.

In WordPress 1.5:

<img alt="WordPress post functionality in 1.5" src="../../Resources/images/design/write_post_title_1_5.jpg" width="600px" />

In Shuttle:

<img alt="Shuttle design February 2005" src="../../Resources/images/design/write_post_title_shuttle.jpg" width="600px" />

WordPress 2.0:

<img alt="WordPress 2.0 write post screen" src="../../Resources/images/design/write_post_title_2_0.jpg" width="600px" />

Another change suggested by the Shuttle team was the implementation of collapsable pods in the Write screen so that elements such as post status, categories, and author, could be collapsed.

In WordPress 1.5:

<img alt="Functionality on Write screen in WordPress 1.5" src="../../Resources/images/design/pods_wp_1_5.jpg" width="200px" />

In version 8 of Shuttle:

<img alt="Version 8 of Shuttle with mocked up pods" src="../../Resources/images/design/pods_shuttlev8.jpg" width="200px" />

In WordPress 2.0

<img alt="WordPress 2.0 Pods" src="../../Resources/images/design/pods_wp_2.jpg" width="200px" />

Feedback on the elements of Shuttle that were included wasn't always positive. WordPress 2.0 shipped with a number of Shuttle-inspired changes. On her blog, [Molly Holzschlag wrote that](https://web.archive.org/web/20060203042213/http://www.molly.com/2006/01/05/wordpress-20-and-akismet/) "what WP2.0 has gained in interface appeal it's lost in some practicality too." For the Shuttle team, the problem was the [piecemeal implementation of their vision](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-design/2006-January/000559.html).

The project was beset by other problems. Despite having a closed mailing list to avoid the "too many cooks" problem, they had that problem anyway. The setup of the group meant that no one had responsibility for the overall vision of the project. Ideas were discussed and sent around, and while the team all got on well, formed friendships, and enjoyed working together, when one reads back the mailing list now it feels like a design-focused discussion forum rather than a team with a clear task.  No one had sole responsibility for the vision of the group and no one stepped up to take that role on. As the group discovered, having a group of designers, each with their own ideas, can cause as many problems as opening a design list up to a bunch of hackers.

The other issue was the length of time it took for the group to get work done. A lot of time was spent discussing minor elements of the design such as rounded corners and gradients, rather than asking fundamental questions about WordPress users, what they needed and what they wanted. "I don't know if we were cooperating enough on getting a unified feel and a unified understanding of everything before we were trying to actually apply our ideas to the problem," says Michael now. Besides that, all of the contributors had jobs that took up a lot of their time, so work happened in fits and starts. While the original plan was to complete the admin redesign within a period of around three months (by mid-April) this was pushed to September. Then the team [missed the deadline for WordPress 2.0](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-design/2005-November/000502.html) in late 2005. The next deadline given to them was the end of January (for inclusion in WordPress 2.1, which itself never materialised), but a complete set of mockups was never produced until March 2006.

It was then that Khaled sent round a complete set of screenshots that was his vision for the new WordPress admin:

![Shuttle Dashboard](../../Resources/images/design/shuttlefinal/Dashboard.jpg) 

![Shuttle Write Screen](../../Resources/images/design/shuttlefinal/Write.jpg) 

The rest of the group loved the designs and work was delegated to the developers on the team for coding. As with the rest of the project, the developers took a long time to work on the code. In mid-April, [Michael Heilemann withdrew from the project](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-design/2006-April/000721.html), saying that he had to prioritise his other commitments. The same month, [Khaled asked](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-design/2006-April/000723.html) whether Matt or Ryan would ever get around to implementing it themselves. [Matt's response](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-design/2006-April/000730.html) was that the redesign was a medium-priority and that changes would be made iteratively. 

On May 14th 2006, [Khaled posted the designs to his blog](https://web.archive.org/web/20061105004935/http://www.brokenkode.com/archives/shuttle-launched/), finally sharing the complete set of designs with the WordPress community, and bringing the Shuttle project to a close. He was still, however, under the impression that the mockups would be implemented in due course. In August 2006, Byran Veloso, who by that time had joined Automattic as an employee, posted on his blog about his [own implementation of the Shuttle project](https://web.archive.org/web/20061109234833/http://avalonstar.com/2006/08/09/wordpress-ywmc-the-post-screen/). For Khaled, this demonstrated that his own designs would never be implemented and that Bryan, as part of his role at Automattic, was taking on the role of redesigning the admin. [He used his blog as an outlet for his anger.](https://web.archive.org/web/20061112181001/http://www.brokenkode.com/archives/contributing-to-open-source/). He felt that his considerable work and thought was ultimately being dismissed. 

He wasn't the only person to feel disenfranchised and the other members of the group slowly drifted away from the community. Chris Davis and Michael Heilemann made the switch from WordPress to the Habari project (which was conceived in September 2006), and Bryan Veloso became more enmeshed within his work at Automattic.

The biggest failure around the Shuttle project, wasn't the designs, nor even the implementation of the designs, but the process itself. To solve one problem, the group closed itself off from the community but in doing so caused even more. Cut off from the rest of the community they lost touch with the actual development process. Since it was closed, when life took over and there was little activity on the project there was no opportunity for another enthusiastic party to take the project on. The wider community had diverging feelings about the project - its secret nature gave it a sense of mystery, hype grew around the project with the expectation that it would be a spectacular redesign of the admin. But for others there was growing resentment that a blessed group of designers was working on something that everyone had a stake in.

In one of the final emails on the wp-design mailing list, [Matt outlined](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-design/2006-May/000732.html) some of the things that he learned about design-oriented open source projects:

> * Work should not be done in private
> * Design by committee doesn't work, better to break up tasks and let individual people focus on one section
> * Focus on lots of incremental changes, rather than giant redesigns (you end up in the same place, and probably sooner)
> * Document the process and decisions along the way
> * Code concurrently with the designs (and iterate)
> * Don't hype it, expectations get out of control
> * Avoid scope creep of features into designs
> * Set a deadline and stick to it



They were joined in January 2006 by Toni Schneider, who Matt had met in San Francisco through GigaOm founder Om Mailk. Toni was brought on board as CEO, or "adult supervision" as the startup world is fond of saying when an experienced CEO is brought in the shepherd young developers who have struck on a good idea. Toni's background was at OddPost, the webmail service that had been bought by Yahoo! Toni was a developer who became a CEO at a startup which was successfully acquired by one of the net's giants. OddPost became the basis of Yahoo! mail and Toni became a vice president at the company. After setting up the Yahoo! Developer Network, Toni left for new challenges at Automattic. 		
It was at OddPost that Toni had his first exposure to the power of open source projects. At a time when OddPost didn't have a spam filter, Paul Graham came out with his idea of [Bayesian spam filtering](http://www.paulgraham.com/spam.html). He open sourced the idea, and Toni's team implemented it at OddPost. "It just showed me that this is a really powerful model," he recalls.		

He was attracted to Automattic by the challenges of building a product around open source software. WordPress already had brand recognition but no one was making money from it yet. In a [2006 interview he said](http://money.cnn.com/2006/04/18/magazines/business2/startuptype/index.htm)		

> WordPress is an interesting new challenge because it's not like most startups, where the world still hasn't heard of you. WordPress is way past that stage. On the other hand, there is no business yet. Until Automattic came along, there was nobody working for it. It was all volunteers. So taking that product momentum and somehow turning that into a business will be really interesting.		

In Toni, Matt found someone with a development background, who had moved into the business side of the tech industry, who liked telling the story and bringing products to a larger audience.		

Other aspects of the project attracted Toni: this was a product that wasn't just a central, proprietary service, it wasn't owned solely by Matt or anyone else, but by all of the people involved, and it was open to anyone getting involved. Users could get involved in the process and have a stake in it, in a way that they couldn't with many of the other services around- Twitter and Facebook, for example. 		

And there was power in the fact that anyone could set up a WordPress blog. People are proud that they get it to work. Non-developers can set it up on a server and they feel empowered. It's different to just signing up to a service like Gmail or Facebook; WordPress is something that you can make your own.	
Automattic brought together the founders' experience in open source development and Toni's experience in business. There were certain things that worked in the project, that they wanted to maintain within the company, principles of open source development that underpin Automattic.	
The first of these was that the company should be distributed. Contributors in a FOSS project come from all over the world and collaborate together online, finding tools that suit their needs, and building their own when they're unavailable. The internet is perfect for this sort of development. Automattic sought to maintain this distributed nature, enabling it to hire people from all over the world, based on their skills, not on their location. Toni recalls how, in the early days of Automattic, people expected the distributed nature of the company to break down. It went against traditional businesses which kept employees supervised and in one place, with a focus on hours instead of output.		

In order to maintain this distributed nature, many of the early employees came from the project, and were already experienced at working in a distributed environment. Working online came natural to them. Those that found working in this way difficult didn't last at the company. Part of the recruitment process was ensuring that people were made aware of that it's like to work in a distributed environment. Eventually, Automattic developed a trial projects process, whereby potential employees would do a trial, working in the distributed environment to see if the company was the right fit.		
Automattic wanted to maintain a multiple release model, in which developers could push multiple small releases a day straight to the user. They eschewed the traditional [waterfall model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model), a development process which involved following a prescriptive sequence: drawing up specifications, design, construction, integration, testing and debugging, installation, and maintenance. At Automattic, developers could write patches and build features and push them straight to users.		
	
Automattic adopted a [continuous deployment](http://toni.org/2010/05/19/in-praise-of-continuous-deployment-the-wordpress-com-story/) model. By May 2010, Automattic had over 25,000 releases, averaging around 16 releases a day. Rather than optimising for perfection, the process is optimized for speed. Features are broken down into small components and code is incrementally launched. This means that developers and designers can quickly push their products to millions of users within a few second.		

It also helps to ensure that the people who build the product have a direct connection to the customer, doing away with as many levels of mediation as possible. This method of development keeps product people happy because they get to constantly push new ideas to customers, and customers happy because they're constantly getting new toys to play with and their feedback helps to refine the product.		

Following the initial setup of Automattic, the bulk of hiring was done from within the open source project. Seven of the first ten employees of Automattic were from the WordPress community, all of whom had an intimate knowledge of both developing and using the software. 		

Automattic had, at its fingertips, a wealth of developers who were not just experienced in the product, but who were passionate about it and who were committed to it, evidenced already by the fact that they had put considerable volunteer time into it.		
	
Automattic needed to be careful that the community didn't become disenfranchised from the product. It would have been easy, particularly when Toni was brought on board, for the perception to turn - a business man is brought into the project, people might think that Automattic was going to start charging for things.

From the very start, there was a lack of clarity about what was part of Automattic and what was part of WordPress.	 The two developers who led WordPress were both employees of Automattic, which appeared to make it an Automattic project. It was unclear even on the [original Automattic about page](https://web.archive.org/web/20051224051341/http://www.automattic.com/projects/) which lists WordPress as an Automattic project. 		

This was because, at its inception, Automattic was intended as an umbrella company for a number of different organisations, that would include Moebius Ltd and WordPress Inc.  It was also the case that, at that time, much of the work on WordPress was being done by employees at Automattic. It wasn't until much later that the confusion over who owned what would settle down.		
This confusion was compounded by the name of Automattic's blog network: "WordPress.com". While naming a company WordPress Inc might have taken things too far, the decision was made instead to call the main project WordPress, and have a shared name of WordPress.com and WordPress.org. "We gave the company this advantage of being able to call it's service WordPress.com," says Toni. "It's been a curse and a blessing." On the one had, people are always getting confused between the two, and many people don't even care that there is a difference. It confuses everyone from the press to WordPress users. The mainstream tech press, for example, frequently describes Automattic as the "[maker of WordPress](http://mashable.com/2014/04/09/automattic-acquires-longreads/)", which does a disservice to the hundreds of contributors who aren't at Automattic. The WordPress.org support forums are littered with questions about WordPress.com, and WordPress.com users are confused as to why they can't install plugins. On the other hand, Automattic has put millions of dollars into growing the WordPress brand and introducing the product to people who would instead of gone to Blogger or Tumblr or some alternative blogging service rather than going down the self-hosted route. It's unlikely that the open source project would have had the money or the drive to do such extensive branding. There are many people whose first exposure to WordPress is via WordPress.com, and some of those shift to the open source project. A survey carried out by WordPress hosting company WP Engine, found that 30% of respondents had heard of WordPress. 		
	
The WordPress.org support forums was one of the places where the confusion over WordPress's name caused even bigger problems, When WordPress.com was initially set up, there were no support forums. This meant that WordPress.com users [found their way to the WordPress support forums to get help](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/bug-images-not-showing-in-categories). WordPress.com was a hosted service, so neither WordPress.com users or support forum volunteers had access to the server or code to carry out debugging. There was little that the volunteers could do to help them. [Discussions](http://codex.wordpress.org/IRC_Meetups/2005/September/September21RawLog) were had about this issue at a [number of IRC Meetups](http://codex.wordpress.org/IRC_Meetups/2005/September/September28RawLog).		

This influx of WordPress.com users added to the workload of the volunteers, which was fine so long as WordPress.com was a free service. But "I don't mind supporting people who are all for the free stuff", said [masquerade](http://profiles.wordpress.org/masquerade), at a September 2005 Meetup, "but as soon as wp.com goes paid, I'm not helping them. I won't be matt's slave with no pay." Eventually, WordPress.com started providing support itself, first of all via an email address, then on a community support forum where customers could help each other, and later using a ticketing system. Matt hired Mark Riley, Podz, at Automattic, and for a long time he was solely responsible for support at WordPress.com. The next person hired for support was in 2008. In that time 49,486 support tickets were closed Nowadays, WordPress.com users have a community on their own forums and a huge team of "Happiness Engineers" provides support across Automattic, but still, it's not uncommon that one of them lands on the WordPress.org forums looking for help.	
nother way that Automattic sought to make money with WordPress.com was through providing enterprise-level support services to big websites that had more extensive support needs than the average WordPress user. Big, prominent sites such as CNET, About.com, and the New York Times were using WordPress, and other sites, such as GigaOm, Techcrunch, and Scobelizer, were shifting to WordPress.com.		

Automattic courted these big sites, initially as a marketing strategy. There was nothing that said "WordPress can scale" better than having big, high-traffic sites, hosted on it. If they were running WordPress successfully, then it was the best possible example that WordPress could run high-traffic, complex websites. Toni approached big websites to offer to host them on WordPress.com. The first included Scobelizer and the second Life Blog. Time was spent making sure that the companies were happy, making sure Akismet was set up, figuring out what plugins they needed, and providing support.		

What many of them needed was dedicated support from WordPress experts. At the start, Automattic saw their competitor as Typepad, who charge $49.95 for their enterprise version. Automattic tested different subscription levels. When they [launched the WordPress Support Network](http://toni.org/2006/06/26/automattic-support-network/) their subscription level was $5,000 per year. Also in 2006, they offered enterprise-level hosting - [when WordPress.com VIP hosting launched](http://ma.tt/2006/09/wordpresscom-vip/) it was priced at $250 per month.		

It soon became clear the because a piece of software was free, it didn't mean that the services around that software had to be cheap. Companies were prepared to pay enterprise prices to ensure that their website could scale and stayed online. Automattic, and other companies in the WordPress ecosystem, just had to develop confidence in building up their pricing structure.		
	

The relationship between Automattic and the wider WordPress community hasn't always been an easy or straightforward one. Much of the tension between Automattic lay around the WordPress trademark. Getting the trademark and registering the domains was part of Toni's early work at the company. He had to figure out how to ensure WordPress was an open enough brand for everyone to participate in without it becoming a confusing mess. Matt hadn't yet secured the trademark, and it wasn't until [March 2006 that Automattic filed to register the WordPress trademark](http://www.trademarks411.com/marks/78826734), with the registration completing in January 2007. 		
One of the major flash points in 2006, which led to huge dissatisfaction amongst not just the Habari founders but in the community more generally was around inline documentation. There was strong support in the community to improve WordPress' inline documentation. For many developers, digging into the code is the best learning tool that they have. In February 2006, Rich proposed [that he document WordPress' functions](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-February/004921.html) and asked if there was a philosophical objection to having inline documentation. Carthik [responded that](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-February/004926.html) it was frowned upon because it would lead to bloat. He referred to a thread from May 2005, [when Matt said](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2005-May/001114.html):

> Commenting is tricky. Some "well-commented" code I've seen had a bunch  of lines of repetitive filler that "documented" what you could easily see by just looking at the code itself and doubled the size of the program. APIs should be documented religiously, but I think spending a ton of time on redundant comments for code only a few core hackers will ever look at will bloat the codebase and waste everyone's time. I also  believe that well-written code usually doesn't need comments unless it's doing some sort of voodoo or workaround.

The proposal, however, had wide support across the community, with some developers offering to [take on the labour themselves](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-February/005084.html). Rich's initial proposal started a long discussion about the best way to generate documentation from the code and the best format for inline documentation, but it was [ultimately stalled by Matt](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-February/005088.html) who argued that documentation shouldn't be auto-generated, pointing to the Codex as the best place for documentation.

Over the coming months there [continued to be support for inline documentation in the community](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-March/005481.html). [Tickets were opened but left ignored](http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2473), and Owen Winkler created his own [developer function reference](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-April/005534.html)

![Owen Winkler's Function Reference](../../Resources/images/chapter-6/winkler_fn_ref.jpg "Winkler function reference")

It was within the context of this discussion that a central community member expressed his dissatisfaction with the project. For Scott Merrill, the quashing of the inline documentation efforts was a sign of Matt's autocratic approach to the project. In a long post on the wp-forums mailing list, [he outlined his issues with the project](http://codex.wordpress.org/IRC_Meetups/2006/February/February22RawLog), which he sees as being caused by Matt's unilateral decision-making. 

> Rather than fix the codex (one mechanism of which would be to install a fresh MediaWiki installation into a new directory, and then manually copy-and-paste pages from old to new -- yes, we'd lose history, but we'd keep the damn docs usable), Matt wants to write a new plugin for WordPress to "solve" the problem.  This is perfectly acceptable from Matt's point of view, even though the documentation continues to suffer in the meantime.
> But when others come along and volunteer to "solve" the problem of inline function references, Matt poo-poos the whole effort as a waste of time, saying instead that such documentation belongs on a publicly editable wiki.  Forgive me for not leaping to participate when the current wiki situation is abominable.
The following month, Scott announced on his blog that he would [no longer be participating in the WordPress community](http://skippy.net/wordpress-less). As someone who had been active on the forums, documentation, plugin development, and core, other members of the community were sad to see him go. It wasn't long, however, until other developers followed him, and just a few months later, the Habari founders had that lunch in Bucca de Beppo.

The issues around documentation weren't limited to inline documentation. Mark Riley (Podz) one of WordPress' longstanding forum moderators, [pointed out in 2006](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-forums/2006-March/001530.html) that the WordPress Codex was failing users. For example, it was [recommended on the Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/index.php?title=Hardening_WordPress&oldid=16988) that users hide which version of WordPress they were running, but the code itself contained a comment asking users to leave the information for statistical purposes. Mark also complained that the content in the Codex meant nothing to WordPress users. He cites the section on permissions which said "All files should be owned by your user account, and should be writable by you. Any file that needs write access from WordPress should be group-owned by the user account used by the webserver." WordPress has a low barrier to entry for users, but the documentation that came with it wasn't easy enough for them to understand.

Discussions like these brought up a tension that was perhaps inevitable given WordPress' low barrier to entry especially for setup and install. While anyone could set it up, not everyone who did so knew about server configurations, so while they could use WordPress, they couldn't necessarily use it safely. 

This relationship between the developers and the support team, is clear when looking through the wp-hackers mailing list. Again and again, Mark Riley posts questions that come up on the support forums to try and get help from developers. There is a sense of frustration as he tries to get the answers from the developers that the users need.

A clear fault line was around release dates. Almost every release cycle, Mark made a request asking to be informed in advance the release date so that he could ensure that the support forums were properly manned when the new version came out. Again and again, a release would arrive with him unaware of it. "All I am trying - and yet again complete failing - to ask,"  [he asked on the mailing list](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-March/005310.html) "is that IF you want support for the product it would nice to at least let the forums know. You guys just don't see it do you? You really don't have a clue."

These tensions between the core development team and the volunteers who worked on areas such as support and documentation, were a feature of WordPress for some time, to the point that even the core developers noticed. Owen Winkler recalls:

> Within WordPress, more weight was given, like significantly more, to where no one else was getting any credit, for contributions that were not code. So you contribute code? Oh you're a king! That's great! But you're doing support, like user support on the forums? Whatever.

The first paid upgrade launched by WordPress.com was [CSS editing](http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2006/08/04/custom-css/#comment-4663), which gave WordPress users the flexibility of editing their theme with CSS. Shortly afterwards, domain mapping was launched. This was an obvious feature to charge for, because the domains had to be paid for. While other sites such as Blogger were proving domain mapping for free, Automattic decided that if you were serious enough about your website to require your own domain name, then you could pay for that. Later that year [they launched file storage](http://wordpress.com/blog/2006/12/06/running-out-of-space/).		

These upgrades made sense, particularly the ones that incurred additional costs for Automattic, as in the case of storage and domains. Some upgrades weren't particularly successful. Matt recalls now that the most unsuccessful upgrade was [unlimited private users](http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2006/10/27/unlimited-users-on-private-blogs/). This upgrade let users have more than 35 members on a private blog. Other features were more controversial. In 2006, Automattic [tested Google Adsense on WordPress.com](http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2006/07/27/testing-ads/), before rolling them out across WordPress.com blogs. It wasn't until 2009 that Automattic introduced a paid upgrade that [allowed WordPress.com user to remove the ads](http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2008/09/18/go-ad-free/). 		

While Toni was being recruited for Automattic, [the company received its first funding](https://ma.tt/2006/04/a-little-funding/). He wasn't officially CEO of Automattic at that time, but he had committed to the position. Having a solid CEO in place gave investors confidence that the business would be able to flourish. On top of that, WordPress already had a head start. WordPress.com had already had nearly 200,000 signups, and could demonstrate that it had potential. It was already built and people were using it, now was a good time for investors to get on board.		

That early round of funding took some of the heat off Matt and Toni in terms of staying on top of paying employee's salaries. Donncha, for example, reports that in the early days Matt or Toni had to go to the bank to pay his salary.
The first WordCamp happened in August 2006 at the Swedish American House in San Francisco. It was set up by Matt, as a "barcamp-style" conference: ""BarCamp-style" is a code phrase for "last minute."" [he wrote on his blog](http://ma.tt/2006/07/wordcamp/). He announced the WordCamp on 9th July, with August 5th as the date, and no venue settled. They did, however, manage to pull it together, and despite some snafus with the sign-up process, the event went well. At that very first WordCamp San Francisco some WCSF traditions were started: most notably Matt's annual State of the Word presentation, and barbecue for lunch.
As work on WordPress 2.1 continued, Ryan posted to wp-hackers about [getting WordPress 2.0 into Debian stable](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-October/008871.html). At the time, WordPress was part of the Debian unstable/testing distribution. For inclusion in the stable distribution, WordPress 2.0 would need to be maintained for 3-5 years. Mark Jaquith was the developer who took on the task of maintaining the 2.0 branch. A commitment was made to maintain the version for three years, until 2010. This involved backporting security issues to ensure that the version remained stable.	

However, during that period there were major changes to WordPress' security which involved complete reworks of how various systems were handled.  It reached the point at which backporting those changes into the 2.0.x branch could have introduced new bugs or instability. The developers also found that fewer people were using the 2.0 as the introduction of new features meant that people were encouraged to upgrade to the latest version. The legacy branch continued just six months shy of its target of 2010, and [was deprecated in July 2009](http://wordpress.org/news/2009/07/the-wordpress-2-0-x-legacy-branch-is-deprecated/).	

[Requests for a long-term support branch haven't gone away](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2010-June/032447.html), however, specifically from the big companies that are using it as a CMS. It's unlikely that WordPress will ever start a new branch. Matt [wrote to wp-hackers](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2010-June/032483.html):	
> Not backporting is a conscious decision. I would rather invest 100 hours in backward compatibility in a new version than 2 hours in backporting a  fix to an obsolete version of WordPress. Plus, as noted by everyone else, backporting was often impossible because it wasn't one or two line fixes, it was architecture changes that would touch dozens of files. The LTS was actually *less* stable with these "fixes" backported because it had almost no one using it.	

Part of the frustration was the funnel through which all patches went before being committed. Ryan posted that the [reason for the funnel](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-March/005192.html) was "to avoid having such bridge  burning arguments happen in the repository rather than in ticket comments." He did say that he wouldn't mind broadening the funnel. There were those in the project who had worked in other open source projects with open commit policies that [supported the funnel](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-March/005195.html). "Loose control leads to spaghetti code and flame wars over inconsequential issues," wrote Douglas Daulton. Ryan also took the time to [codify some of the process](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-March/005190.html). Every commit must be accompanied by a ticket. Before commit, the code is reviewed by at least two people - one for a code review and the other for an integration/architecture review. These reviews were carried out by trusted contributors. A #wordpress-dev channel could, he said, help facilitate discussion around development. Some people did note positive changes to the project. Mark Jaquith [pointed out the success of the Bug Gardening scheme](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-March/005189.html) which had distributed some of the workload and led to "a whole slew of people who are autonomously fixing bugs, submitting  patches, and having them committed." He also pointed out that the trac mailing list had been a positive change as it meant trac tickets had become places for discussion.	

The question of who should have commit access to the WordPress repository comes up again and again. There are regular threads requesting that more people be given commit. They want it for a number of different reasons: to speed up the development process, to acknowledge the contributions of project regulars, to create a more egalitarian project structure. Adding a new committer to a project is a major decision - it demonstrates that someone is trusted enough to be able to commit code directly to the repository.	

[Karl Fogel describes committers as](http://producingoss.com/en/producingoss.html#committers) "the only formally distinct class of people found in all open source projects."  "Committers are an unavoidable concession to discrimination in a system which is otherwise as non-discriminatory as possible," he writes. As much as one tries to maintain that commit is a functional role, commit access is a symbol of trust, both in terms of coding skills and in terms of a belief and adherence to the project's core beliefs and ethos. It creates a power dynamic between those that have commit access and those that don't.	

By having only two committers - Matt and Ryan - the project tried to avoid an "us and them" mentality amongst contributors, in which committers had higher status than everyone else. By opening it up to more people, they could create a feeling of dissatisfaction amongst those who didn't get commit access. But by not opening it up at all, there was a sense of frustration amongst developers who felt that they could never progress within the current structures of the project. The other disadvantage to having so few committers is that the project was growing, as was the number of patches that were coming in.	

In the wake of these discussions, a number of developers went to form the Habari project. However, changes did start to happen later that year, not because of pressure from contributors, but because of more pragmatic reasons. It was during this release cycle, that the funnel started to break. Ryan says:	

> For a long time I was the funnel. Matt really liked to have a funnel. But the funnel broke. Because the funnel was overwhelmed. So we started adding more funnels.	

As a way to alleviate pressure and help get things moving, [Ryan gave commit access to Mark Jaquith.](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/4270). Mark had been involved with WordPress since 2004, coming to the project along with the exodus from Movable Type. It was a sign that the funnel was starting to broaden, and over the next few releases more committers would be added,

Commit access wasn't just given out on the basis of coding expertise or how much work a developer had done. Adding a new committer meant trusting them to follow through with the vision of the project, to be someone sympathetic to the project's user-first ethos. Then, and now, that's a key aspect in deciding who is given commit access. "It's not just that you've shown a commitment to contributing," says Peter Westwood now, "but you also have shown an understanding of the ethos of the community and their shared beliefs, and their philosophies."	
WordPress' release cycle has often been sporadic, particularly in the early days. Sometimes releases just had a few months between them, other times longer. Between 1.2 and 1.5, for example, there was a gap of 265 days. The codebase was packed with changes and the decision was made to skip a few version numbers, [going straight from 1.2 to 1.5](http://wordpress.org/news/2004/12/version-skip/). The next version released was 2.0, with 314 days between releases. But the longest delay between releases was 2.0 (released December 31 2005) to 2.1 (released January 22 2007), with the release cycle taking more than a year. It was the delay to this release that caused the development team to take a more serious look at how the development process operated. Since WordPress' first release, new versions had been arriving haphazardly, and as the number of users and developers grew the outside impression of the project was somewhat chaotic.	

During the 2.0 release cycle, the mailing list was active, more developers than ever were attracted to the project, and WordPress was downloaded 1.5 million times. But while emails were being sent, no code was actually being shipped. The [release post for WordPress 2.1 has a plethora of new features](http://wordpress.org/news/2007/01/ella-21/); it was constantly slipping in one more feature that caused the release to take so long.	

While WordPress 2.1 was still in development, there was a discussion on wp-hackers about [moving to a 120 Day release cycle](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-October/008907.html). Matt wrote that a release could look like:	

> 2 months of crazy fun wild development where anything goes	
> 1 month of polishing things a little bit, and performance
> Feature freeze.	
> 1 month of testing, with a public beta release at the beginning	

The response was largely positive from the development community, and when WordPress 2.1 was released, it was the first to launch with a release date for the next version, [April 23rd for WordPress 2.2](http://wordpress.org/news/2007/01/ella-21/). It was subsequently [released on 16 May](http://wordpress.org/news/2007/05/wordpress-22/). 	

 Just prior to the announcement of Habari in January 2007, Matt posted to the mailing list to [apologise for his stance on the issue of inline documentation](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-December/009812.html). "Sorry there was such a fuss over that before," he wrote, "that was pretty silly, I think I understand the issues better now." This was followed up with [inline documentation patches](http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2474#comment:7) being [committed to core](http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2473#comment:3).

Just prior to filing registration, a domain policy was added to WordPress.org, requesting that [community members not use WordPress in their domains](https://web.archive.org/web/20060221154915/http://wordpress.org/about/domains/). 		

Once the application to register the trademark was submitted, Automattic had to go about protecting the trademark. This meant getting people who used WordPress in their domain name or product name to change it. It wasn't entirely straightforward. WordPress had been a community project for two years and many people felt that they had a stake in it. There were plenty of websites that used WordPress in their domain names. And it wasn't wholly clear what people could and could do. In the comment thread of [Lorelle van Fossen's blog](http://lorelle.wordpress.com/2006/10/26/using-wordpress-in-your-domain-name-dont/), community members are curious as to whether they can use label "on WordPress" (as in "Lorelle on WordPress") on their blogs. 		

One domain change that [caught some attention in the community](http://wank.wordpress.com/2006/03/17/wanky-wank-wank-wank/) was a site called wordpress-arena.com which was [running a WordPress theme contest](https://web.archive.org/web/20060422014104/http://www.arenawp.com/?p=10). In the comments, Matt left a message of support, along with a note that said "Unfortunately for every cool usage (like this competition, potentially) there are a dozen scammers and spammers misusing WordPress, selling spamming scripts or copies of WP itself."		

Six months later, cease and desist letters were sent out people who persisted in using WordPress in their domain, and Matt found himself up against some of the net's most popular internet marketers. The incident was centered around two websites that had been running for some time with WordPress in their domain name: [wordpressvideos.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20060402224841/http://wordpressvideos.com/), run by Brandon Hong, and [wordpresstutorials.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20060705071350/http://www.wordpresstutorials.com/), run by Sherman Hu. A blogger called [Andy Beard alerted the community](http://andybeard.eu/112/wordpress-trademark-scammers.html) to the fact that the two websites had been asked to stop using the name WordPress in their domain. In his post, he remarks on Automattic's tardiness in actually registering the domain and preventing others from using it. He also takes issue about the two sites being singled out: one of them had been online for a year and both provided WordPress services and had cultivated their own communities, they weren't, he felt, the "spammy products" that Matt thought they were. Besides, just a year early, Matt had hosted a link farm on WordPress.org.		

Matt took to the comments and [left a comment that had the internet marketing community up in arms](http://andybeard.eu/112/wordpress-trademark-scammers.html#comment-44):		
> I find most affiliate marketing quite distasteful, and we have not even though of hiring anyone in those or SEO fields, or offering training for any of the above.		
					
> When we do documentation or videos, it's free to everybody.		
					
> If Sherman Hu or Brandon Hong had spent their time contributing to the Codex or support forums instead of trying to sell WP snake oil and taking advantage of a lack of good documentation in Open Source community software, I bet they would have made a lot more honest money by now.		

People [jumped to the defence of the two websites](http://andybeard.eu/112/wordpress-trademark-scammers.html#comment-63). Even those who were supportive of Automattic's position with regards to the trademark, were angered by Matt's positioning of the two sites as "snake oil" salesmen. Customers and friends of Sherman Hu flocked to the blog post to voice their support for Sherman. Outside of that blog, prominent internet marketers wrote about it on their blogs. They took issue with Matt branding long-copy sales letters as spammy and scammy. [Brian Clark, at copyblogger, pointed out that while a website's design](http://www.copyblogger.com/does-your-copy-look-spammy/) might not appeal to some people, it will appeal to others. That Sherman's and Brandon's website and branding didn't appeal to Matt didn't mean that it wasn't appealing to other people.		

Eventually the [sites came to an agreement with Automattic](http://andybeard.eu/134/wordpress-tutorials-business-as-usual.html), and [WordPress Videos came out with a redesign](https://web.archive.org/web/20061130162903/http://www.wordpresstutorials.com/?).
In an [essay on his blog](http://ma.tt/2010/11/one-point-oh/), Matt describes the year between 2.0 and 2.1 as "a dark time in WordPress development history, a lost year."  The problem wasn't a rift in development or any major changes in the project, but the constant desire to slip in just one more feature, a refusal to acknowledge that that new feature could wait until the next release. In fact, a faster development model meant that shifting features to different releases was trivial. Or, at least, it could be, depending on how that feature was developed.	

The [Habari Motivations](https://web.archive.org/web/20070111191036/http://code.google.com/p/habari/wiki/Motivations) page lists the reasons for being involved with Habari. Each of the motivations is something that the founding developers saw as wrong within the WordPress project, that they wanted to change in their own project. 

The [first Habari user was Chris Davis](http://chrisjdavis.org/changes-around-sillyness), who switched his blog as soon as their was a version that he could work with. More influential people in the WordPress community followed suit. One of these was Michael Heilemann, the designer of the Kubrick Theme. For him, [WordPress was moving in a more commercial direction] (http://web.archive.org/web/20070117005952/http://binarybonsai.com/archives/2007/01/07/time-to-habari/), "There's no shame in that, things change after all; but sitting here on my high horse of idealism and sparetime open source projectness (_so_ a sentence!), I cannot help but crave for the days of old."

Michael undertook a redesign of the Habari interface, which he says now was both a good and a bad experience. He had a good experience designing it, a bad experience getting it approved, and a good experience implementing it. The experience that he had getting it approved came down to the fact of Habari's meritocratic structure. A lot of time was spent discussing approving the new admin interface. People would weigh in with opinions who weren't designers but whose voice was given equal credence. For Michael, this left him feeling that he couldn't get his work done and he ended up bowing out of the community. When asked about whether he is more comfortable with a BDFL or Apache-style model, he says now: 

> It's easy to end up in very long discussions if everybody has equal footing. And that makes for a great democracy, but it's also very hippie, 60s, everybody gets to sit around and share their opinion, but that's not always something that's really worthwhile. You don't actually, necessarily, get a better product out of it. And so often you need somebody with vision, or at least somebody with a point of view with opinion to weigh in.

Positive aspect of forking
Another fundamental disagreement between the Habari developers and Matt and Ryan was around coding best practices. From its inception, [questions were asked about whether WordPress would be rewritten](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/how-much-will-you-rewrite#post-16). WordPress' focus has always been on users, and maintaining a good experience for them. Habari, on the other hand, was intended to be useful to users, but at its heart was an educational tool for developers. One of the driving ideas behind Habari was to create a tool that taught people about development, development best practices, and being part of an open source project. Rich Bowen, who did't know a lot of PHP, said that he hoped that the new project would teach him about it. This meant not just teaching developers about PHP, but educating them about best practices around coding methods and being part of an open source community. They eschewed WordPress' low barrier to entry in favour of an approach that would cultivate fewer developers but better developers. 

In a post [announcing the Habari Project](http://skippy.net/spread-the-news), Scott Merrill writes about how one of the founding principals behind Habari was to make it fully object-oriented. 

> This has resulted in some wonderfully efficient code, and so far the system is remarkably fast. Object oriented programming allows us to streamline the development of user-created plugins; allows us to integrate a unified error handling system; and vastly simplifies the construction of our Application Programming Interface.

Habari was written in PHP 5.1, allowing the developers to use [PHP Data Objects](http://php.net/manual/en/intro.pdo.php). This gave them a level of database independence which WordPress lacked. 

WordPress was completely focused on users, and ensuring that nothing broke for users. Habari was concerned with creating an educational tool for developers. On the one hand, the Habari developers found fault with WordPress for not using the latest coding practices, on the other, the WordPress developers felt that Habari's approach messed with users. As [Ryan Boren memorably put it](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2007-February/010881.html):

> Screwing users because developers want to play is not cool. It's a good way to become irrelevant. A big reason WP is so popular is because it is not infatuated with the latest, greatest developer lust objects that require users to upgrade their platform.

In February 2007, when Ryan wrote the above comment, PHP 4 was still running on 88.44% of websites. PHP 5 adoption was slow and many web hosts didn't support it. If WordPress had made the switch to PHP 5 it would have meant that it was suddenly become unavailable on a huge number of hosts. 

![PHP Major Distribution Stats in February 2007](../../Resources/images/chapter-6/php-graph-2007.png "PHP usage statistics")


The other sign of this difference of emphasis is in the choice of license. WordPress has a GPL license, which is intended to secure the freedoms of users. Habari, on the other hand, uses the [Apache License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0). This permissive license allows developers to take the code and make use of it in any way, even if they use it in a proprietary product. In the Apache License, the emphasis is very much on developer freedom. Owen Winkler outlined the reasons why the Habari project chose not to use a GPL license:

> There's the idea of developer freedom. If you give the software away you should be able to give it away with no requirements at all. If you want to take it and make software that you sell, then go ahead and do that. Hopefully you won't. Hopefully you'll contribute. Or if do, you'll contribute what you make back to the community somehow.
