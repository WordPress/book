It wasn't obvious how someone could make money while still being in line with the ethos of a free software project. How could the two ever be commensurable? In those early days of the WordPress economy the distinction between freedom and free beer was often blurred. Community members fumbled for answers: is making money commensurate with a project whose core ethos is based on the GPL?  Who has the right to make money out of a project that belongs to all of its volunteers? How can a business be run when the core product is given away for free? This chapter will look at these issues, and at the frontiers on which battles around commercialisation, licensing, and distribution were fought.
In March 2007, the Plugin Directory was launched. This gave exposure to developers using WordPress and made it easier for users to find plugins.

Prior to the plugin directory, lots of developers would just host their plugins on their website. The plugin directory gave them exposure to a huge amount of new users. Samuel Wood ([Otto42](http://profiles.wordpress.org/otto42), recalls how the plugin directory encouraged him to distribute his code. "I was writing them before, but I didn't give them to anybody. It encouraged me to release plugins because I had a place to put them."

Both the WordPress community and the wider blogging community were maturing. Developers from diverse background were attracted to the project, and 2007 saw the project's first major disagreement around database architecture. In the early 2000s, discussions about the best way to organise information were widespread on the internet. Content has metadata assigned to it, that can be used to organise and display data. Traditional modes of classification in the web used top-down methods in which the schema was imposed from above. These structures were often rigid, forcing users to shoehorn their content into something that didn't necessarily fit. A new method of classification was emerging - tags, a bottom-up of form of classification, in which an index, or a cloud, can be generated based on keywords that the content creator applies to the content.	

The first system to use tags was social bookmarking site [Del.icio.us](https://delicious.com/). While Del.icio.us wasn't pioneering as a bookmarks manager, it differentiated itself with its tagging system. Users can tag saved links, which are used to relate tags to each other within a user's collection. They are also used to relate tags to each other across the entire social network, so visiting the link http://delicious.com/tag/php will display all of the links that have been tagged PHP.	

Controlled, top-down, ways of classifying content were failing to scale on large-scale Web 2.0 applications in which millions of users were creating and organising their content. It wasn't proving to be possible to force users to use controlled vocabularies. [Clay Shirky discussed the problem](http://many.corante.com/archives/2005/01/07/folksonomies_controlled_vocabularies.php):	

> users pollute controlled vocabularies, either because they misapply the words, or stretch them to uses the designers never imagined, or because the designers say "Oh, let's throw in an 'Other' category, as a fail-safe" which then balloons so far out of control that most of what gets filed gets filed in the junk drawer. Usenet blew up in exactly this fashion, where the 7 top-level controlled categories were extended to include an 8th, the 'alt.' hierarchy, which exploded and came to dwarf the entire, sanctioned corpus of groups.	

The system of classification using mass tagging systems came to be known as a [folksonomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folksonomy). This is a classification system in which users classifying content themselves. 	

In 2005, Technorati, the blog search engine, [launched its own tagging system](http://www.sifry.com/alerts/archives/000270.html). This created a tag search across major platforms such as Blogger and Typepad, CMS like Drupal, and other services such as Flickr, Delicious and Socialtext. 	

WordPress, however, lagged behind, and there was pressure from both the open source and WordPress.com communities to add tags to the platform. The native form of classification in WordPress was categories, a hierarchical, top-down mode of classification. A website owner might use it to create their navigational structure, for example. To interact with WordPress, [Technorati picked up the "tag" from the WordPress post's category](http://lorelle.wordpress.com/2005/09/11/adding-technorati-tags-to-wordpressmu-sites/#comment-113). This was unsatisfactory to lots of users as categories and tags are two different types of classification.	

On his blog, [Carthik Sharma wrote](http://carthik.net/blog/vault/2006/02/21/tags-are-not-categories/):	
> categories can be tags but tags cannot be categories. Categories are like the huge signs you see on aisles in supermarkets â€“ "Food", "Hygiene", "Frozen" etc, they guide you to sections where you can find what you are looking for. Tags are like the labels on the products themselves.	

Categories and tags had two different, distinct use-cases. Categories are more rigid, whereas tags are a lightweight way of classifying content within a website. There was, of course, a plugin that did the job: WordPress users installed the [Ultimate Tag Warrior](http://neato.co.nz/ultimate-tag-warrior/) plugin (though WordPress.com users could not).	

In 2007, a ticket was [opened by Ryan Boren to support tagging in WordPress core](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3723). It was finally agreed that WordPress would have tags. The next step was decide on the database schema. 	

Ryan proposed two database schemas. One of these [created a new table for tags](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/3723/tagging.diff), the second put [tags in the current categories database table](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/3723/tags.diff). 	

The second proposal was spearheaded by Matt, who felt that it didn't make sense to create another table exactly the same as the categories table. In a [comment on trac he wrote](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3723#comment:16):	

> We already have a ton of rewrite, API, etc infrastructure around categories. Mostly I see tagging as a new interface to the data. On the display side, people want their tags listed separately from their categories, and probably something like a tag cloud function.	

WordPress had already successfully reused tables in the past; for example, posts, pages, and attachments are all stored in the same table, and at that time the categories table also contained link categories. The addition of tagging functionality, from a user's perspective, enabled them to tag posts, display a list of tags, and display posts with the same tag. What was the point in duplicating the infrastructure when it could be achieved within the current table system?	

The proposal to put tags in the same table as categories [did not go down well with many developers](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2007-April/011730.html). Categories and tags are two different ways of organising data within WordPress, they argued.	

Arguments against included concerns that the category table would become bloated, and that putting tags in the category table would mean including additional code to keep the two taxonomy types separate. This additional code could introduce new bugs, make it harder to maintain in the future, and make it difficult for developers to extend.	

Matt checked in his proposal for a taxonomy structure in changesets [#5110](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/5110) and [#5111](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/5111). 	

Much of [April 2007 on wp-hackers](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2007-April/thread.html) was spent discussing the new database schema for taxonomies. A suggestion that got considerable traction from the community was that categories, link categories, and tags, all be split up into their own individual tables, but no one could come to a consensus. Eventually, there was a [call for WordPress 2.2 to be delayed](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2007-April/011901.html).  	

Matt posted a new thread on wp-hackers [stating the case for using the categories table](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2007-April/011930.html). He argued that: 1. it would perform faster as no additional queries would need to be carried out to support tags. A separate tag table would require at least 2 extra queries on the front end. 2. that it would provide a better long-term foundation. Tags and categories would be able to share terms (for example the category "dogs" and the tag "dogs"). 3. That there were no user-facing or plugin-facing problems.	

In the thread, he also proposed a new table, inspired by Drupal's taxonomy system, specifically for terms within a specific taxonomy. This would allow for terms to be shared amongst taxonomies while having the same ID. Ryan Boren, who had been strongly opposed to the schema which put tags and categories in a new schema, [proposed a new solution](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2007-April/011991.html), one which enabled individual terms to participate in all taxonomies while keeping the same ID.	

His schema was a three-table solution, with a table for terms, taxonomies, and objects. The term table would contain the ID, name,  and slug for each term. The term_taxonomy table put the term within the context of a taxonomy. The term_relationships table related a term to a post, link, or another object. This approach would have the advantage of allowing one ID for a term name while using another table to related them to a specific taxonomy. It would be extensible for plugins, which would be able to create their own taxonomy. It would also enable large multisite networks, such as WordPress.com, to create global taxonomies - unified tagging systems in which users of different blogs could share terms within a taxonomy.	

Discussion went back and forth, a [new trac ticket was opened up](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/4189) and a new structure was created based on Ryan's original proposal. The first table wp_terms, holds basic information about single terms. The wp_term_taxonomy gives the term context by placing it within a taxonomy. The final table, term_relationships relates objects (such as posts or links) to a term_taxonomy_id from the term_taxonomy table.	

As with many WordPress features, tags landed on WordPress.com before they were shipped with WordPress. From the beginning, they caused huge problems. Costs skyrocketed when 10-15% more servers had to be used to enable to support the load that the additional tables and queries brought. [check this with Barry]. "it was slower to be completely honest," says Matt, "that was a cost that we saw in a very real way on WordPress.com, but also a hidden cost that we did impose on everyone who was doing WordPress in the world."	

The new taxonomy system, which at the time felt like a compromise, has had caused lasting issues for the WordPress project.	
As well as being a challenging code problem, the activity around the implementation of taxonomies highlighted problems in the development process. Some proposed that the release be delayed, others that the feature be pulled, others still that they ship with the current schema with a view to revising it in the next version. Andy Skelton [raised this point in the WP-Hackers discussion](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2007-April/011988.html):	

> To include a premature feature in an on-time release degrades the quality of the product. I refer to not only the code but the state of the community. Increments are supposed to be in the direction of better, not merely more. Better would be to release on time with a modest set of stable upgrades.	
						
> To block release while the one new feature gets sorted out would be a maladjustment of priorities. If 2.2 seems light on sex appeal, so be it. Better to keep the release date as promised.	

The 120 day release schedule was in danger of being completely blown away by this one issue. Making major architectural changes to core just weeks before a release was contrary to the aims of this new development process. A thread was opened up suggesting that either the [release of 2.2 be delayed](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2007-April/011901.html). The architectural changes were too important to be done in an unsatisfactory way.	

The other issue that people had was that Matt had checked in code without prior discussion. As the lead developer of the platform, this gave the appearance that a decision had been made, which caused arguments amongst the developers.  "I committed it directly," he says now,  "So rather than discussing it through the ticket as much as I should have or things like that and people took badly to that." This "stems from a difference of philosophy about the role of trunk," says Matt. For him trunk is  a place for experimentation, a starting point for discussion. It doesn't mean that a decision has been made. However, the workflow that was adopted by everyone else in the project was to create a patch, upload it, and wait for discussion and review. Reverting code written and committed by a project lead is a more political act than reverting code written by anyone else in the project. 
With discussion around taxonomies continuing, Matt made the decision to [delay the 2.2 release](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2007-April/012090.html), pulling tags out of core and bringing in widgets as a user-facing feature to encourage users to upgrade.		

Features, when they are suited to all WordPress users, are usually developed by the WordPress core team, and Automattic internally develops ones suited to WordPress.com users. This hasn't always been the case. Early on, Andy Skelton developed a [widget user interface](http://andy.wordpress.com/2006/03/08/widgets-user-interface-and-api/) for WordPress.com. This was hugely popular with WordPress.com users - it made their WordPress themes even more flexible. The [community consensus](https://codex.wordpress.org/IRC_Meetups/2006/June/June07RawLog) was that widgets would make an excellent addition to core, and they were [brought in in WordPress 2.2](http://wordpress.org/news/2007/05/wordpress-22/).	
One of the pitfalls of carrying out discussions in public spaces is bike shedding. In his book, [Producing Open Source Software](http://producingoss.com/), Karl Fogel reprints [an email from Poul-Henning Kamp](http://bikeshed.com/) to the FreeBSD mailing list with the title "A bike shed (any colour will do) on greener grass..." In the email Kamp gives an example from [Parkinson's Law of triviality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law_of_triviality):	

> Parkinson shows how you can go in to the board of directors and get approval for building a multi-million or even billion dollar atomic power plant, but if you want to build a bike shed you will be tangled up in endless discussions.	

This is because the atomic plant is so vast that only very few people can grasp it, and the board of directors assume that somebody has the knowledge and has done the groundwork. In contrast, anyone can build a bike shed, so everyone will have an opinion on how it should be built, and, more specifically in open source discussions, what color it should be.	

There is a tendency for software mailing lists and forums, over time, to descend into bike shed discussions. As the technical difficulty of an issues goes down, the "[probability of meandering goes up](http://producingoss.com/en/producingoss.html#bikeshed)." If a discussion is highly technical it can be difficult for everyone to follow along, but there are other discussions in which everyone can have a say. 	
[From _Producing Open Source Software_](http://producingoss.com/en/producingoss.html#bikeshed)	

> consensus is hardest to achieve in technical questions that are simple to understand and easy to have an opinion about, and in "soft" topics such as organization, publicity, funding, etc. People can participate in those arguments forever, because there are no qualifications necessary for doing so, no clear ways to decide (even afterward) if a decision was right or wrong, and because simply outwaiting other discussants is sometimes a successful tactic.	

With the fast rate of growth of its community and its low barrier to entry, the WordPress project has been as susceptible to bike shed discussions as any other open source project. A [Google search for "bikeshed" on the wp-hackers mailing list](https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Flists.automattic.com%2Fpipermail%2Fwp-hackers%2F+bikeshed&oq=site%3A&aqs=chrome.2.69i57j69i58j69i59j69i65l3.2535j0j4&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=91&ie=UTF-8#q=site:http:%2F%2Flists.automattic.com%2Fpipermail%2Fwp-hackers%2F+bikeshed&safe=off) displays a number of discussions in which a respondent has cried "bike shed", as does a [similar search on trac](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/search?q=bikeshed&noquickjump=1&changeset=on&ticket=on).	

Of course, one person's bike shed is another person's bÃªte noire, and there are a number of instances in which matters that appeared trivial flared up into long community discussions.	

There is an example from 2007, when discussion about what to call Links got heated. A [poster to wp-hackers asked](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2007-June/013299.html) "Anyone know why it's still called Blogroll in admin, when it's called Bookmarks in functions (wp_list_bookmarks) and yet displays by default as a list of "Links" in the sidebar?" The original post, entitled Blogroll, Bookmarks, Links, generated a total of 79 emails, and discussion spilled over from the mailing list and [on to a trac ticket](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3695).	

Theme sponsorship was the first attempt by theme designers to make money out of their designs. A designer often includes a credit link back to their own website in their theme. Kubrick, for example, had a link back to Michael Heilemann's website. Every site that installed the theme meant a link back to the designer's website. The number of incoming links to a website is a variable in Google's PageRank algorithm; the more incoming links, the higher the PageRank, the further up in Google's search engine results. If hundreds, or even thousands, of people installed a theme, the designer could see themselves soar up Google's search results. Even better if that link came from a high authority website. 

Designers soon caught on that the link didn't have to be to their website - it could be to anything at all. The links had an intrinsic value, particularly to internet marketers. With a link in a WordPress theme, marketers didn't have to approach individual sites to ask them for a link back; all they had to do was pay a web designer to include it in their theme, release the theme for free, and soon hundreds of sites would be linking back. 

For many it started out as a means of supporting their ability to distribute themes for free, but with WordPress growing in popularity it quickly became a problem. 

[stat on WordPress' growth]

Theme sponsorship happened in a number of different ways. Sometimes companies would buy links by getting in touch with well-known theme authors to ask if they would sell the links in their themes. Theme authors themselves were also pro-active. Authors [set up websites where they would advertise and sell their themes](http://themey.com/), others would [auction the theme at Digital Point](https://forums.digitalpoint.com/threads/for-sale-pirates-of-the-caribbean-wordpress-theme-coded.284382/), or simply auction the links. Once the sale had been made, the theme was promoted on lots of different WordPress theme sites, including official sites such as the WordPress Codex, community resources like the WordPress theme viewer, and reputable blogs such as Weblog Tools Collection. These themes were often distributed with a [Creative Commons 3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/) license, which permits free sharing and adaptation of the theme, provided the credit link remains. 

It didn't take long for websites focused on online money making to catch on. [Tutorials and articles were written about how to go about theme sponsorship](https://web.archive.org/web/20070306065553/http://www.doshdosh.com/link-building-and-seo/link-building-with-word-press-theme-sponsorship-a-good-idea/), and it became part of an acceptable "link building strategy".

Theme authors who carried out theme sponsorship usually fell into a number of different categories: some published themes with visible text links but didn't tell their users about the link, others used PHP or CSS to hide the links, others still made it clear that the theme had been sponsored. 

For [those who were in favour of theme sponsorship](https://web.archive.org/web/20130524074921/http://www.headsetoptions.org/2007/04/09/the-other-point-of-view-%E2%80%93-a-designers-opinion-on-sponsored-themes/), the matter was a simple one of being paid in return for work carried out. They shouldn't, they argued, be expected to create WordPress themes for free. Why shouldn't they be compensated for the work that they had done? Selling sponsored links was a way of ensuring that they could create and distribute themes for free, which benefited the whole community. They argued that designing a good theme takes time and that free themes were inevitably of a poorer quality than sponsored themes. Sponsored themes became endemic, with even respected sources [selling links in their themes](http://www.bloggingpro.com/archives/2007/04/03/wordpress-theme-release-insense/). It became a ["great business model"](http://www.blogherald.com/2007/04/06/sponsored-wordpress-themes-a-great-business-model/); finally a way to make money from WordPress! Besides, they argued that the default WordPress blogroll contained links to all of the original developers of WordPress - Alex, Donncha, Dougal, Michel, Matt, Mike, and Ryan - all of whom were benefiting in Google's search results. 

On the other side were those that argued that themes.wordpress.net was becoming a [repository for spam](https://web.archive.org/web/20070409100127/http://blogdesignsolutions.com/2007/03/31/wordpress-theme-sponsorship/). [More than 50% of themes](https://web.archive.org/web/20070417004542/http://www.wpdesigner.com/2007/04/05/deteriorating-community) on the WordPress Theme Viewer were sponsored themes. These contained links for everything from iPhone repairs to gambling websites, to web hosting and flower delivery. Some themes were uploaded multiple times with only minor changes, thereby increasing the number of links on the theme viewer. Critics of theme sponsorship, many of whom were designers themselves, blamed the practise for deteriorating the community. They weren't against theme designers making money, but they didn't want to see the WordPress community become a hive of spam and shady SEO techniques. Theme sponsorship opened the floodgates to an excess of internet marketing and SEO techniques.

The issue of buying and selling links went beyond the WordPress community. A few years earlier, Matt Cutts, the head of web spam at Google, posted on his blog about how [link selling affected PageRank](http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/text-links-and-pagerank/). Google's algorithm detected paid links, and while it wasn't foolproof it worked pretty well. The problem with paid links was that they made it harder for Google to determine the trustworthiness of a website. Google, as a result, took away that site's ability to give reputation: 
> Reputable sites that sell links won't have their search engine rankings or PageRank penalized â€“ a search for [daily cal] would still return dailycal.org. However, link-selling sites can lose their ability to give reputation (e.g. PageRank and anchortext). Users were in a position that their site could be penalised for links that they weren't even aware that they were hosting on their website. Hidden links could have an even more detrimental effect on a user's PageRank. 

In a post in April 2007, Matt Cutts returned to the the issue of selling links, condemning the practice of [hiding links in a website](http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/hidden-links/) and asked web masters to make a full disclosure about paid links on their websites.

However, there were plenty of themes around that contained links that weren't sponsored. Designers [included a credits links in their footer](https://web.archive.org/web/20080104150212/http://www.adii.co.za/2007/04/11/design-credit-ramblings-again/), linking back to their own website. Designing and releasing a WordPress theme was a way for many designers to increase their profile on the web. Like the internet marketers, their websites would benefit from higher search engine results, and website visitors might click on the link, sending business to the designer. 

At that time, it was common for designer to release their themes under a creative commons license, with the only restriction being that the user leave the credit link in tact. In the middle of the furore about sponsored links, however, one designer took the next step. Tung Do, [tungdo](http://profiles.wordpress.org/tungdo) was the author of popular WordPress resource WPDesigner.com along with a number of popular WordPress themes. In April 2007, he announced that he was [releasing all of his themes under the GPL](https://web.archive.org/web/20080113192235/http://www.wpdesigner.com/2007/04/10/switching-from-creative-commons-to-gpl/). "Despite that I'm just ONE theme designer and despite that I don't contribute directly the WordPress code," he wrote, "I believe that switching to GPL is a step in the direction to support the WordPress team and to help the WordPress theme community grow (positively)." 

The first website to take direct action against sponsored themes was Weblog Tools Collection (WLTC). WLTC was a popular blog at which theme authors could submit a theme. Mark Ghosh, who ran the site, regularly posted about [new theme releases](http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2007/04/20/wordpress-theme-releases-for-0420/). In April, Mark weighed in on the issue of sponsored themes. While he didn't condemn them outright, he did instate a new policy: 
> all themes with sponsorship links will be labelled as such when they are published, non-sponsored themes will be published first and we require sponsorship disclosure to be made to us when authors make us aware of their new themes. If this disclosure is not provided and the theme has sponsored links, the author will be barred from being able to post their new themes on weblogtoolscollection.com until further notice. 

The [166 comments in the comment thread](http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2007/04/09/sponsored-themes/#comments) highlighted just how divisive the issue was.

A few days later, Matt followed Mark's lead and [himself posted on WLTC about the issue of sponsored themes](http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2007/04/12/on-sponsored-themes/). He had [become aware of the trend of including advertising links in themes](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-September/008293.html) back in September 2006 when he had downloaded the Barthelme theme from plaintxt.org and it contained a link to New York flower delivery service. For him, the issue came down to three main issues: 
- that sponsored links could negatively impact a user's Trustrank and that the user hadn't made this decision themselves; 
- that theme sponsorship constituted adware; 
- that theme authors who sell links and release it under a creative commons license were on shaky licensing grounds themselves. 

The argument that theme authors deserved to be compensated for their work held little weight when WordPress itself had been built by volunteers for free. There was no opposition from the project to people making money from WordPress, but official WordPress resources should only promote companies and individuals that did so in a way that was in line with the ethos of the project.

Matt closed the post by [linking to a vote on WordPress.org](http://wordpress.org/ideas/topic/remove-sponsored-themes-from-wordpressorg) on a proposal to remove sponsored themes from WordPress.org. The discussion on the thread has arguments for and against theme sponsorship; some voted for a complete ban, others for sponsored themes simply to be disclosed, while others felt that it was a theme designers prerogative to include whatever links that they wanted in their theme.

It was clear, however, that whatever the results of the vote, sponsored themes would not be looked upon favourably at WordPress.org, with sites and persons promoting sponsored themes already [banned from the WordPress.org forums](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/wp-theme-hockey). Even Matt Cutts weighed in with his position, posting on his blog that he [agreed 100% with Matt on sponsored themes](http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/by-the-way-2/).

In July, Mark announced on WLTC that he [would no longer post about sponsored themes](http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2007/07/10/no-sponsored-themes-on-weblogtoolscollection/) and shortly after [Matt announced that all sponsored themes would be removed from themes.WordPress.net](http://ma.tt/2007/07/wltc-high-ground/). Despite a positive reaction from much of the community, there was a backlash, directed particularly towards [Mark](http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2007/07/16/turning-the-other-cheek/) and [Matt](http://ma.tt/2007/07/love-and-hate/).

Many theme developers saw theme sponsorship as a valid way of making money, and [were angered at being branded as "unethical"](https://web.archive.org/web/20130523083509/http://www.mandarinmusing.com/2007/07/14/if-i-could-walk-on-water-you%E2%80%99d-complain-i-can%E2%80%99t-swim/), particularly when they saw other theme developers acting in other ways that were unethical; [downvoting other developer's themes and employing sock puppetry to upvote their own](https://web.archive.org/web/20130313072629/http://www.mandarinmusing.com/2007/03/02/wordpress-rating-scams-and-new-releases-march-2nd-2007/), for example, or stuffing themes with huge numbers of links to their own website.

Despite the banning of sponsored themes on official WordPress resources, the practice of selling links continues today. The Digital Point forums, for example, are filled with [themes available for sponsorship](https://forums.digitalpoint.com/forums/template-sponsorship.128/). It is not without its pitfalls. In 2012, a former theme sponsor [posted on the Webmaster world forums](http://www.webmasterworld.com/google/4445558.htm). He is being penalised by Google for incoming links that are "inorganic": 
> Some 2+ years ago in throws of questionable wisdom I sponsored about 5 or 6 WordPress themes where the "Designed by" link in the footer gets replaced by a link to your site. They were nice looking and "relevant" themes, at least as far as the name and pictures used in design suggest. They were not used much initially and I did not think much of them until these "unnatural links" notices started flying a month ago. Google confirmed that these links were the issue, but with the themes in the wild there wasn't a whole lot that the sponsor could do about it other than contact the websites using the theme and asking them to remove the link. 

Sponsored themes were the first way that people, en masse, tried to make none from WordPress themes. There were people doing custom design and development, but selling links in themes seemed like a valid way of making money, particularly on an internet that abounded with SEO experts and internet marketers on an unremitting search for ways to climb Google's search results. Sponsored themes brought WordPress, not for the first time, into proximity with SEO, both white hat and black hat. Selling links in a theme could easily slide into questionable SEO practices. Besides, it wasn't a business model that was sustainable. With Google the rule-makers, a simple rule change could wipe out an entire market.
From sponsored themes, the theme community moved to premium themes. For many themes, the main difference between a premium theme and another WordPress theme was money. Users would download a free theme at no cost, or would pay for a premium one. The designation "premium", however, carried the implication that themes that a user paid money for were _intrinsically better_, as though attaching a price tag somehow elevated premium themes above other, free (and inferior) themes.

The appearance of premium themes implied something lacking in free themes - whether in design or functionality. If users wanted that special something they were going to have to pay for it. But what was [different about premium themes](https://web.archive.org/web/20080121035631/http://www.adii.co.za/2007/09/21/what-makes-a-premium-wordpress-theme/), other than the price tag?

It often seemed that the community wasn't quite sure what made a theme premium. When the question "[What makes a WordPress Theme Premium](http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2008/01/12/what-makes-a-wordpress-theme-premium/)" was asked on WLTC [there was a large range of responses](http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2008/01/12/what-makes-a-wordpress-theme-premium/#comments) that included: better documentation and support, less bloggy, better design, better features, better code, more functionality. Or, at least, that's what community members felt premium themes should include. A substantial number of community members maintained that the only difference between free and premium themes was money.

Whatever the feeling in the broader community, designers and developers who were making both free and premium themes distinguished between them according to the time and effort they put into them, and the level of effort required to set them up. In [an interview in June 2008](http://vandelaydesign.com/blog/wordpress/free-vs-premium/), premium theme developer Darren Hoyt talked about the differences between creating a free and a premium theme. He outlines the following considerations for him as a developer: 
- that hand-coding and tweaks to the files should be minimised for the user. As a result he created a custom control panel. 
- as a developer he didn't feel that users should have to download additional functionality in the form of plugins so all of the functionality for the theme was bundled with it. "We tried to make Mimbo Pro more than just a theme or "skin" and more like an application unto itself."
- that best practices with regards to commenting code, valid markup, and well-written CSS be followed. 
- that documentation be provided and evolve. 
- that buyers get ongoing support and interactions with the developer.

Brian Gardner, designer of Revolution, [said in a March 2008 interview](https://web.archive.org/web/20080427183149/http://www.revolutionizeyourblog.com/askthanks.php) that for him what makes a premium theme is how the site looks and acts. When asked what makes a theme premium he answers "if people respond to a site and say 'wow, I can't believe WordPress is behind that,' that's what premium themes are all about."

Although sites like Template Monster sold WordPress themes as early as 2006, it wasn't until 2007 that designers within the WordPress community started to do so. The last quarter of 2007 had the first surge in WordPress premium theme releases. August 2007 saw [Revolution](https://web.archive.org/web/20070825022722/http://www.briangardner.com/blog/the-revolution-begins.htm) from Brian Gardner which one of the first premium WordPress themes, and a few weeks later Tung Do released [Showcase](https://web.archive.org/web/20071016132417/http://www.wpdesigner.com/2007/09/10/showcase/). Later that year saw [Proximity](http://www.nathanrice.net/blog/premium-wordpress-themes/) from Nathan Rice, Charity Ondriezek's [Cornerstone Theme](https://web.archive.org/web/20080106173642/http://designadaptations.com/notebook/a-cornerstone-to-build-from/#comment-2836), Adii Pienaar's [Premium News Theme](https://web.archive.org/web/20071106033124/http://www.adii.co.za/2007/11/02/the-launch-of-premium-news-theme), and early the following year [Thesis](http://www.pearsonified.com/2008/03/diy-themes-pre-launch.php), from Chris Pearson.

Many of the premium theme sellers started out authoring free WordPress themes, had built up a following, and decided to see if they could make money out of their hobby. None started with the intention to make a career out of it, it was just something they did to make money in their spare time or as a side project while studying at university. Many of them also did independent development for clients at the same time. The idea that selling WordPress themes could be big business didn't cross their minds.  "Even when I quit my job to spend more time working on these themes," says Adii Pienaar, co-founder of WooThemes, "and eventually rebranding and calling that effort WooThemes, I still thought that I was going to build a business around the custom design/development stuff, around consulting."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    

From the outset [theme sellers](https://web.archive.org/web/20081005045548/http://www.briangardner.com/blog/how-much-would-you-pay-for-a-premium-theme.htm) were not quite sure how to price and license their themes. At that time, there wasn't yet a consensus in the community about how themes should be licensed and there was no official, legal, stipulation from the WordPress project. As a result, theme authors tended to create their own license. A common approach was that a user would either buy a single-use license, and if they wanted to use it on more websites they could buy more licenses, or a bulk or developer license. As well as restrictions on use, the licenses also restricted what the user could do with the theme. They sometimes, for example, had a requirement that the user retain the author credit in the theme, enabling the authors [to charge for removal of the attribution link](http://diythemes.com/thesis/remove-attribution-link/).

The response from the community varied widely between users, developers, and other community members. The [Revolution user who interviewed Brian Gardner](https://web.archive.org/web/20080427183149/http://www.revolutionizeyourblog.com/askthanks.php) was a keen Revolution advocate and it was clear from his enthusiasm that he appreciated the guaranteed support, comfort, safety, and the feeling that he was being looked after. A price tag didn't necessarily equate to these things, but some premium theme developers did a good job of looking after their customers and saw their theme sales continually rise. With WordPress growing in popularity, it was no longer confined to the world of personal blogging. Businesses, particularly small businesses, were using WordPress to build their websites. Paying a small fee for peace of mind was a worthwhile trade-off. When you pay money for a theme you expect to get support. A free theme comes with no guarantees.

Not all theme developers were selling premium themes. Other theme developers were frustrated by premium theme sellers. "'Premium', when it comes to WordPress themes," [writes Ian Stewart in a blog post in 2008](http://themeshaper.com/2008/02/28/the-future-of-premium-wordpress-themes/), "simply means 'it costs money' and not 'of superior quality'." The false dichotomy set up by the "premium" designation was an unintended slur against those who released their themes for free. Justin Tadlock proved that there was [nothing to stop a developer from releasing a fully-featured bells and whistles theme](http://justintadlock.com/archives/2008/02/24/options-wordpress-theme) for free. He was one of the first to explore an alternative business model, setting up [his own theme club](http://justintadlock.com/archives/2008/05/31/project-m). In contrast to theme sales, he wanted to create a community around theme releases and support. Later that year he [launched Theme Hybrid](http://justintadlock.com/archives/2008/08/05/wordpress-theme-club-launch).

It wasn't a clear-cut issue, though there were plenty of community members who thought it was. Some people thought that they could either be involved with the community, or make money out of selling themes or plugins. A wp-hackers thread from March 2008 [asks for feedback on the premium theme concept](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2008-March/018694.html). The original poster, Glenn Ansley, [says](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2008-March/018730.html) "I guess it all goes back to what one's primary goal for developing under the WP platform is: money or contribution to the community." Mark Jaquith [was quick to point out](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2008-March/018792.html) that it wasn't a black and white situation. It's possible to make money with WordPress while still making a positive contribution to the project. Business and open source didn't have to be either/or - it works best when symbiotic. 

In the same thread, Matt outlined how he saw businesses best interacting with the WordPress community: 
> A GPL software community is like the environment. Yes you could make  profit building widgets in your widget factory and not pay any heed to the forests you're clearing or the rivers your polluting, but in a few years you're going to start to deplete the commons, and your business and public perception will be in peril. [...]
> Contrast that with sustainable development, with giving back to the community that sustains (and ultimately consumes) your services and you have the makings of something that could be around for generations to come.

At that time, he didn't see the premium theme market as commensurate with the community. He [described premium theme sellers as being in](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2008-March/018780.html) "murky waters" and pointed out that there wasn't much money in the enterprise. In [a conversation with Ptah Dunbar](https://web.archive.org/web/20090625070845/http://ptahdunbar.com/news/wp-news-theme-update-and-matt-mullenwegs-views-on-premium-wordpress-themes), he said that he didn't like were premium WordPress themes were going, that the premium theme market wasn't helping the community to grow.  

Whatever the community thought, users wanted to pay for themes, and companies that sold themes were making money. ThemeForest is a good example. The marketplace doesn't just sell WordPress themes but sells themes for different CMS, as well as HTML Templates. Upon launch in September 2008, ThemeForest sold mostly HTML templates and about 25% of sales were WordPress Themes. By September 2009, WordPress themes made up around 40% of all ThemeForest sales. Today, WordPress themes make up around 60% of all sales.

Early discussions and debates often focused whether someone should or should not be making money from WordPress. From those debates a more nuanced question emerged: under what licensing terms should themes be distributed? WordPress itself is licensed under the GPL; the GPL's distribution terms ensure that the distributions and modifications of the software carry the same license. This also applies to derivative works, which is where all of the contention lay: is a theme derivative of WordPress? There were arguments for and against on both sides but often the arguments fell into speculation and opinion, much of which was based on interpretations (or second-hand interpretations) of the license. Court cases were rarely fought around the GPL. Those that came close were often settled out of court, as happened with the [Free Software Foundation vs Cisco lawsuit](http://www.fsf.org/news/2008-12-cisco-suit) which was going on at the same as the WordPress community was arguing about the status of WordPress themes. There were arguments, debates, and misinformation, but the community came down into two camps - those who thought themes didn't have to be GPL, and those who thought they did.

There were a number of different factors involved. One was whether WordPress with a theme was an aggregation or a combination. The FAQ for the GPL [distinguishes between the two](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0-faq.html#MereAggregation): an aggregate means putting two programs side by side (like on a hard disc or a CD-ROM). Some who said that themes didn't have to be GPL, said that WordPress with a theme was an aggregate. A theme modified the output of WordPress, but didn't engage with its internals. WordPress core developers, however, stated again and again [that themes use WordPress core internals](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/theme-licensing?replies=22#post-543507). For a theme to be completely independent it would need to use none of WordPress internal functions. 

When the debate within the community came to a head in 2010, Mark Jaquith wrote a post [outlining why themes are derivative of WordPress](http://markjaquith.wordpress.com/2010/07/17/why-wordpress-themes-are-derivative-of-wordpress/). He writes: 

> It isn't correct to think of WordPress and a theme as separate entities. As far as the code is concerned, they form one functional unit. The theme code doesn't sit "on top of" WordPress. It is within it, in multiple different places, with multiple interdependencies. This forms a web of shared data structures and code all contained within a shared memory space.

For those who accepted that the PHP was linked with WordPress in such a way that the theme inherited the GPL, there was still another possibility: distributing with two licenses, what people often refer to as a "split license" or, [what Matt memorably called](http://themeshaper.com/2008/09/08/the-ethics-of-premium-wordpress-themes/comment-page-1/#comment-8843), "packaging gymnastics". While the PHP in a WordPress theme does work with WordPress internal functions, the CSS, Javascript, and images, do not. Therefore, a theme developer can package their theme with two licenses, one for the PHP and one for the other files. For theme authors concerned about piracy and copyright this protected their intellectual property while ensuring they followed the letter of the GPL. For the project, however, this was simply an evasive game that did an injustice to the spirit of the GPL, i.e. that users be free to do what they want with the software.

Piracy was a major concern for many theme authors. They didn't like the fact that someone could buy their theme and legally distribute it, and even sell it.  Putting a proprietary license on a theme, however, didn't stop people distributing them. Themes from commercial sellers were cropping up on torrent sites all over the web and [being sold on forums such as Digital Point for a cut price](https://web.archive.org/web/20080915174028/http://www.adii.co.za/2008/02/17/pirated-wordpress-themes-get-a-100-theme-for-only-6/). It was easy, if a user wanted, to download a commercial theme for free (though often it came loaded with additional links and malware). 

Other concerns were around making money. How could a business make money selling a product that gave the buyer the right to give it away, or even sell it, themselves? Selling links in themes was banned from official resources and it left theme sellers with two ways to make money: customisation or products. Designers and developers were reluctant distribute with a license that they thought would damage their business.

While Matt suggested that they look into doing custom development, theme sellers were more interested in selling products. It's more immediately obvious how you can scale a business selling products than with services. After all, if you don't factor in support and upgrades, it's possible to sell a digital product ad infinitum, creating a relatively passive income for yourself. Doing custom design or development for clients is restrained by time and resources.

The first theme to be distributed with a [100% GPL license was Revolution](https://web.archive.org/web/20081004003406/http://www.briangardner.com/blog/revolution-going-open-source.htm). Brian Gardner, the theme developer behind it, had fallen upon theme sales like many other theme sellers - he started as a tinkerer, did some contract work doing customisations, started to sell themes, and realised that he could make a business out of it. While developers often came to the project already with knowledge of how an open source project worked, and comfortable with the ethos of selling code, theme sellers came through another route - first they were bloggers, then tinkerers, then designers. Their approach to licensing wasn't that the code should be shared, but that they had to protect their designs. "I and others that were starting to sell themes at that point wanted to protect our work," says Brian now, "we were almost scared of the open source concept where the design and images and the code we felt was all ours and really wasn't derivative of WordPress itself so we sold things on a proprietary level."

What made Brian reconsider, however, was a [comment that Matt left on the theme shaper blog](http://themeshaper.com/2008/09/08/the-ethics-of-premium-wordpress-themes/comment-page-1/#comment-8841):

> I'm happy to give significant promotion to theme designers who stop fighting the license of the platform which enabled their market to exist in the first place, just email me.

This was the encouragement that Brian needed, he emailed Matt to tell him he was interested. He remained cautious and, before making the switch, he [flew out to San Francisco](https://web.archive.org/web/20081002042856/http://www.briangardner.com/blog/meeting-with-matt-mullenweg.htm) with [fellow theme author Jason Schuller](https://web.archive.org/web/20081003091633/http://www.wpelements.com/2008/09/29/from-seattle-to-san-francisco-and-back/), to talk to Toni and Matt. They talked about why theme sellers were using proprietary licenses, and Matt and Toni made it clear that they were happy for theme sellers to make money from themes, but that they wanted them to be GPL. In all of the confusion around the GPL, the message got mixed. Theme sellers thought that they were expected to give their themes away for free.

A few days after the meeting, [Brian announced that from now on Revolution would be GPL](https://web.archive.org/web/20081002153427/http://www.briangardner.com/blog/revolution-going-open-source.htm) and [Jason Schuller followed suit](https://web.archive.org/web/20081004031211/http://www.wpelements.com/2008/10/01/revolution-is-going-open-source-and-im-going-to-join-him/).

Shortly after, the day before WordPress 2.3 was released (with tagging functionality), [WordPress gained two new lead developers](https://wordpress.org/news/2007/09/new-faces/), in the form of Mark Jaquith and Peter Westwood. The announcement post describes them as "a few old faces who are taking on bigger roles in the community" Both committers at the time, they became lead developers at the behest of Ryan Boren, who felt that their contributions went beyond code contributions to more of a leadership role. Both had been active in many of the controversial discussions that had happened in the community. They both, for example, opposed Matt's proposal for the taxonomy structure, and Mark was one of the people to voice concerns over data collection in WordPress 2.3.	

They brought new perspectives to the project's leadership. The announcement post talks about Mark's passion for people using WordPress to express themselves in parts of the world where freedom is suppressed, and Peter's background in software engineering. Mark found that WordCamps particularly played a part in his growing leadership role:	

> People go to WordCamps and they try to look for authority figures. I stood in for him [Matt] at a couple of WordCamps and got into a key position in a couple of WordCamps like 08/09. Yeah, people are just looking for the person who is the WordPress person there, and we have to step up and give them answers.	
With two new lead developers, the funnel was broadened even further, not just in terms of committing to the codebase but also to help with guiding and shaping the project. 	

This was an issue going back as far as WordPress 2.3, when the plugin update notification system was added. This notified users when a new version of WordPress or of a plugin was available for install. Code was added for a [WordPress update notification](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/1476) that collected data from a user's site and sent it back to http://api.wordpress.org. The data collected was the WordPress version, PHP version, locale setting, and the website's URL. A [further piece of code](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/5913) carried a [plugin update check](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/4795), which sent the website's URL, WordPress version, and plugin info (including inactive plugins) to api.wordpress.org.	

Some were unhappy that WordPress was collecting data and storing it on WordPress.org. They thought that [collecting the blog URL was unnecessary](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2007-September/014860.html), others had no problem with WordPress collecting the data, but were [unhappy that WordPress was not disclosing it](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2007-September/014919.html). A ticket was opened on WordPress trac to [request that update checking be anonymised](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5066). A number of people who didn't oppose the changes still felt that there should be an opt-out option so that users who required complete privacy would be able to turn off the data collection.	

Despite the extensive discussion on wp-hackers, [WordPress 2.3 was launched as planned](http://wordpress.org/news/2007/09/wordpress-23/), with the following note in the announcement post:	
	> Our new update notification lets you know when there is a new release of WordPress or when any of the plugins you use has an update available. It works by sending your blog URL, plugins, and version information to our new api.wordpress.org service which then compares it to the plugin database and tells you whats the latest and greatest you can use.	

Matt also posted a [first version of a privacy policy on WordPress.org](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2007-September/015014.html).	

Despite community members being somewhat mollified, it wasn't the end of the 2007 phoning home outrage. As WordPress 2.3 was released, [a post appeared on Slashdot with the following](http://yro.slashdot.org/story/07/09/25/1632246/wordpress-23-does-not-spy-on-users-updated):	
> "Popular open-source blogging engine WordPress has been upgraded to 2.3 -- with some unexpected nasties in the mix. As of version 2.3, WordPress now periodically (every 12 hours) sends personally identifying information (blog name & URI) to the mothership, along with an alarming amount of information including $_SERVER dumps, a list of installed plugins, and your current PHP/MySQL settings. Most unfortunately, it does not provide any way of disabling this functionality, and WordPress does not have any privacy policy protecting this information. In a thread about the issue, lead developer Matt Mullenweg defends his actions and staunchly refuses to add an opt-in interface, telling users to 'fork WordPress' if they aren't willing to put up with this behavior."	

Matt came in for considerable fire for suggesting that people who didn't like it use different software, fork WordPress, or use a plugin the opt-out. The post also [made ripples in other open source communities](http://grokbase.com/t/drupal/development/079s01v924/wordpress-2-3-spies-on-users). The community came to Matt's defence, with some of those who [were critics of how the incident was handled](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2007-September/014904.html) defending [him the most](http://yro.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=307899&cid=20745559). At Matt's request, the original author changed the title to "WordPress 2.3 Does Not Spy on Users."	

As WordPress grew in its user and developer base, more and more people were attracted to the project. Less productive discussion was happening on wp-hackers, and more of the decision making was happening elsewhere. For example, in February 2007 [Ryan integrated phpmailer with WordPress](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3862). A short discussion happened on WordPress Trac (WordPress' bug tracking software) and the code was committed. It wasn't until September that year that a [discussion about PHPMailer happened on wp-hackers](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2007-September/014497.html), a discussion that most of the lead developers absented themselves from.	

Often the discussion focused not so much on producing software but fell into [meta-discussion about the mailing list](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2007-September/015058.html) itself, about the [high signal to noise ratio](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2007-September/015173.html), and about how to [improve mailing list etiquette](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2007-October/015489.html. 	

Some developers took to their own blogs to outline their concerns with wp-hackers. [Andy Skelton wrote](http://andy.wordpress.com/2007/10/03/wp-hackers/):	

> There is just one thing I want to make clear about wp-hackers: a hacker is not someone who discusses or pays lip service or dissents or casts a vote or says what can or should be done. Hackers aren't committee members. Hackers are more interested in proving what can be done than arguing about it.	

This highlighted one of the major problems with wp-hackers. There was too much discussion of code and not enough writing of code, too much opinion and not enough fact. The problem with mailing lists, is that over time they come to be dominated by comments from people who have time to comment. Those who don't have time to comment are the people who you most want to hear from, but they're usually too busy to keep up with a high-traffic mailing list. Mailing lists have the potential to be a time-suck, with a tendency to descend into long arguments driven by people with the time to contribute to such arguments, and drag those who don't have time into flame wars.	

WordPress isn't alone in this phenomena. A [2013 study of the Apache Lucene mailing list](http://sback.it/publications/msr2013.pdf) found that "although the declared intent of development mailing list communication is to discuss project internals and code changes/additions, only 35% of the email threads regard the implementation of code artifacts." As well as discussing development, the mailing list often strayed into discussion of social norms and behaviour. Significantly, the study also found that project developers participate in less than 75% of the discussion and start only half of the discussions.	

The study also found that developers prefer to communicate on the issue tracking software, a finding that is borne out in WordPress as developers took their discussion from the mailing list to WordPress trac. 	

The following year, they did it all over again, and September 2007 saw the first WordCamp outside of San Francisco - WordCamp Beijing.	

This started a trend of WordPress users and community members getting together all over the world. The number of WordCamps has grown exponentially, and every year new WordCamps are set up in diverse countries Japan, Brazil, Kenya, India, the Netherlands, and Russia.	
As sponsored theme sellers drifted away from the community, designers and developers looked for new ways to make money out of themes. The hard line taken by the core project, however, sent out some mixed messages. When the project removed all sponsored themes from official resources the message "WordPress doesn't support sponsored themes" became "WordPress doesn't want me to make money" or "Automattic doesn't want me making money" When theme designers started to sell their themes they were a priori antagonistic. Some felt that Matt only wanted Automattic to make money from WordPress, and there were times when the attitude in the community verged on conspiratorial. The situation wasn't helped when, in the wake of the sponsored themes debate, [Matt announced a WordPress.com theme marketplace](http://ma.tt/2007/11/wpcom-marketplace-idea/), resulting in [cries of hypocrisy](http://www.blogherald.com/2007/11/01/wordpress-theme-marketplace-hypocrisy-from-matt/). Early work was put into the marketplace, with Automattic contacting theme sellers to ask them to create themes to sell on it. However, Automattic decided not to go ahead with the plan, "it didn't seem right to go into it when we hadn't really worked out all the licensing issues yet," says Matt now.

The theme marketplace didn't launch until 2011, four years after the initial announcement. In the interim, all of those licensing issues were sorted out, but it took the community some difficult debates to get there, and everyone involved had to go through an education.

In November 2007, there were still questions being asked about whether the Shuttle project would be implemented, but by that point, [Matt had employed the services](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2007-November/016123.html) of design studio Happy Cog to carry out a total redesign of the admin. The founder of Happy Cog, Jeffrey Zeldman, led the project with WordPress's logo designer Jason Santa Maria, and UX designer Liz Danzico making up the rest of the team.

Whereas Shuttle was primarily focused on aesthetics, Happy Cog was brought in to both identify and correct information architecture problems and update and improve WordPress' look and feel. WordPress needed to be easier to use. 

In an unusual move for Happy Cog, they would produce the comps while the WordPress project would write the code. The scope of the project included user research and an audit of the current interface to identify WordPress' strengths and weaknesses, followed by a new structural design and a new interface design. 

The other unusual aspect of the project for a traditional design agency was that the client was an open source project. The team at Happy Cog was mostly sheltered from the goings-on of the community, but that didn't mean that they weren't aware that this wasn't a normal client. Jason Santa Maria says now:

> Any other client will have customers and their own community, but you really have to just manage the people inside of a company, whereas when you're dealing with an open source project, you deal with the people that you're talking with, but there's this whole gamut of other people that you will only ever get to talk to a small portion of. I think that that's really difficult.

> Plus, I think that on an open source project like this, it's inherently different, not just because it's more of a CMS than an informational website -- the design needs are different -- but it's just a different kind of way to work, knowing that whatever you do probably isn't going to stick around for very long. It's going to continue to evolve and continue to be adapted. Usually, in the very near-term as well, not even 3-4 months from now, but next week.

The first stage of the process was an audit and usability review of WordPress. During this stage, Liz Danzico carried out research to produced a 25 page research audit about WordPress. The intention was to create an admin which would get out of the way. She quotes [a post written by Mark Jaquith](http://markjaquith.wordpress.com/2007/02/21/engine-awareness/) in which he says "That's when I know WordPress is doing its job: when people aren't even aware they're using it because they're so busy using it!"

Liz spoke to Mark Riley, whose experience in the support forums meant that he had direct access to users' complaints. One of the major problems he highlighted was that more and more functionality had been packed into the write screen. Between  WordPress 1.2 and WordPress 2.0 the admin had become cluttered. Functionality had been added haphazardly and then tucked into modules using the pods introduced by the Shuttle project.

A lot of discussion focused on the structure of the navigation, both in terms of the labelling, position, and grouping of functionality. Long discussions were had about whether to go with an object-oriented navigation (Posts, Pages, Comments, etc) or an action-oriented navigation (Write, Manage, etc). Liz's first hunch, supported by the newly-launched Tumblr, was that users preferred navigating by nouns. She felt that what was so confusing to users was that WordPress was organised by verbs. When it came to putting together the navigational structure, both a noun version and a verb version was used. In the end, however, and after limited user testing, the team went with a mixture of nouns and verbs - Write, Manage, Design, Comments. This meant that the functionality for different content types was scattered over different menu items - to write a post, for example, the user would go to "Write" but to manage a post they would navigate to "Manage". 

The Happy Cog team provided extensive and detailed proposals and research for WordPress, all of which was fed back to Matt as the client. Their reports display a sensitivity to web users, and an appreciation of making WordPress more streamlined and simple. 

When it came to the design stage, Jason Santa Maria was tasked with putting together three designs to present to Matt, who would choose one to move forward. 

He designed three early mockups for Matt to choose from:

<img alt="Happy Cog design 2" src="../../Resources/images/design/happy-cog-design-b.jpg" />

<img alt="Happy Cog design 3" src="../../Resources/images/design/happy-cog-design-c.jpg" />

The design that Matt chose was the visually lighter one. Jason had taken a lot of the heavy blues introduced by Shuttle and lightened the interface up. The lighter blues were complemented by an orange accent colour.

When the design was finally signed off by Matt, WordPress trunk started to transform and [not everyone was happy](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2008-February/017849.html) [with the changes](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2008-February/017850.html). There were questions about whether the admin would actually be more usable. Among the [most dissatisfied were those who had been involved with Shuttle](https://web.archive.org/web/20071024231530/http://www.brokenkode.com/archives/new-wordpress-admin/). Many of the comments made comparisons with Shuttle, with community members [emphatically requesting that Shuttle be the new interface](http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2008/01/02/wordpress-24-admin-preview/#comment-1207158). 

Just prior to the release of 2.5, Matt [posted a sneak peek on the development blog](http://wordpress.org/development/2008/03/25-sneak-peek/). This spurred WordPress users into installing the release candidate to get a better look. The response was mixed. [One user talked about the things that bothered him](http://astheria.com/design/evaluating-the-wordpress25-interface) - moving functionality on the post screen to below the post field, for example, and the precedence of the design tab - things which people who used WordPress every day easily picked up on. For many people, especially experienced bloggers, it was [simply a step backwards in terms of usability](http://www.neatorama.com/2008/04/21/wordpress-25-admin-backend-category-shenanigans-and-how-to-fix-it/#!vG29i).

While 2.2 was delayed due to removing taxonomies, the first version to fall significantly behind with the new 120 day release cycle was WordPress 2.4. 2.2 and 2.3 were mostly on schedule, but the Happy Cog redesign caused major changes to the codebase that meant delaying the release. Rather than straightforwardly delaying release, the development team decided to skip a version and [move straight from WordPress 2.3 and WordPress 2.5](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2008-January/016993.html), which was scheduled for release in March.
