WordPress 2.7 brought in what Ryan Boren describes as "the modern era of WordPress". The new user interface introduced with the Crazy Horse redesign, had a left hand sidebar and more usable interface. But a major catalyst for change that came along with that admin was the introduction of Jen Mylo into the project. She had led the Crazy Horse redesign of the WordPress admin, after which time she worked on WordPress as an employee at Automattic.	

When Jen arrived, the project was still quite small. There was a core group of lead developers that were close. They had a Skype chat room that Jen was added to. They also worked in IRC. In [October 2008, she made her first appearance on wp-hackers](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2008-October/021899.html).	
What she brought to the project was a fresh set of eyes and a completely new perspective. So far the project had been run by a group of hackers, many of whom were sympathetic to the needs of users but who weren't always able to put themselves in the user's shoes. Jen had a background in user testing and user experience, something that was largely absent from within the community until she joined the project. "Having someone with an actual formal training in testing and user experience, it was just useful," says Mark Jaquith now. "It was not just useful then, but it also changed us. Or at least it changed me. Where I started thinking in these ways as well and becoming better at stepping out of my own head."	

In addition to bringing a clearer focus on usability, Jen's involvement in the project brought about a bigger emphasis on helping people to contribute in the project. Most of the discussions and activity happened on wp-hackers and trac, and it wasn't always clear how new people could get involved with the project. This was compounded by the project's growth, which meant that is wasn't easy for someone new to the project to get a grasp of what was going on, the project structure, and how to get involved. Jen [wrote a series of posts about how to get involved](http://wordpress.org/news/2009/03/contributing-to-wordpress-part-i-development/), and the development blog became a place to announce [patch marathons](http://wordpress.org/news/2009/04/the-super-awesome-wordpress-24-hour-has-patch-marathon/) and [bug hunts](http://wordpress.org/news/2009/10/upcoming-bug-hunts/).	

She brought more structure to the project - reinstating the weekly development chats, with agendas, and running the meeting as a proper meeting to ensure that things get done. The problem with using just a Skype chatroom is that it doesn't allow for the community to be involved. The main blog at the time was wpdevel.wordpress.com but because it was on WordPress.com and not WordPress.org it didn't feel like it was official.  At the time, there was very little project management. The developers would write code and then push it out. 	

Jen was brought in to the project at a time when Matt was stepping back. Taking on the lead role in terms of development was Ryan Boren, while Jen's responsibility was providing leadership of the community. As the public figure for many of the project's decisions, Jen regularly came under fire from community members, particularly around such issues as [WordCamp policies](http://onefinejay.com/2010/05/19/a-few-questions-on-jane-wells-revised-wordcamp-policies), provoking WP Tavern to eventually write a post titled "[Jane Wells is not so bad](http://wptavern.com/jane-wells-is-not-so-bad)". As Jen recalls now, "Matt calls me a polarizing figure. People either love me or hate me."

Between 2.8 to 3.3, most of the releases were project managed by Jen. Her title on the credits page is UX Lead, but she provided general leadership to the release cycles and a number of major changes happened within the project. 	
	

When Matt took over the theme viewer, [he identified some of the site's major problems](https://web.archive.org/web/20080404175227/http://themes.wordpress.net/blog/4421/version-30/#more-4421). Themes were riddled with security problems, many of them had obfuscated code. Also, the system was continually being gamed, there were duplicate themes, and many contained spam. The aim of the redesign was to create a system more like the plugins directory and repository on WordPress.org. In July 2008, [the Theme Directory was launched on WordPress.org](http://wordpress.org/news/2008/07/theme-directory/), using bbPress (which, at that time, was not a plugin). Theme developers were able to upload a theme which was then hosted on WordPress.org. In WordPress 2.8, it was possible for users to install themes from the WordPress admin.	

Since launch, both the theme and plugin directories have evolved in minor ways. There have been improvements to the plugin directory that have made it easier for plugin developers to provide support, and to have multiple authors for plugins. The theme directory has evolved too, although both still remain on an old version of bbPress. Today, both the theme and plugin repository are undergoing a rewrite, with the creation of a repository plugin that would be open source and available for the community. 	

When the design finally launched, it still wasn't clear whether people disliked it because they didn't like change, or whether there was something inherently wrong with it. Not long after the launch, however, a chance came along to investigate what was really the problem. A friend of Matt's, [Jen Mylo][1], was running a usability testing and design centre at an agency in New York in conjunction with Ball State University. The centre carried out usability studies, including using cutting-edge eye tracking technologies. This was usually for big companies like television networks such as ABC, NBC, and MTV. They happened to have an opening because a TV network didn't have their product ready in time for a test window and Jen was told she could offer it to anyone at cost price. With Automattic having recently received financing from the New York Times and True Ventures, Jen asked Matt if he would be interested in having WordPress tested. 

The usability review consisted of three main stages. First of all, WordPress 2.5 was tested, and some recommendations were drawn up for "low hanging fruit" that would make some improvements to the admin. Following that, the development team created a prototype (Test1515) based on the recommendations to see if they improved users' experience. These two stages constituted Round 1. Finally, based on the Test1515 findings, the Crazyhorse prototype was created and tested in Round 2.

The research team used three main methods for testing:

1. Talk-aloud, in which the participants were asked to think aloud as they carried out tasks.
2. Morae Software recorded screen activity and videoed the participants, and enable researchers to watch remotely.
3. Eye-tracking technology was used to identify granular problems.

The [twelve participants who were involved in the tests](http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2008/05/20/new-york-usability-testing/) carried out a broad range of activities across the WordPress admin. In Round 1, despite finding WordPress generally easy-to-use, the researchers identified a number of problems, including:
1. Verbs vs nouns - users found it difficult to conceptualise their tasks as action-oriented (Write/Manage), instead thinking of their content in a more object-oriented way (Posts, Pages, Comments, etc)
2. Users didn't spend time on the Dashboard, often just using it as an entry point for other pages.
3. The Write Post screen caused problems for users. Tags and categories appeared below the fold, and some participants forgot to add categories and tags before publishing. They would return to the post screen and add them after publication.
4. The comments screen was confusing. Users weren't aware that they had to click a commenter's name to edit a comment, and when they were asked to move a comment to spam they looked in the wrong place.
5. Users were confused by the difference between uploading and embedding media in the media uploader.

On top of this there were a number of minor issues around settings, the media library, link categories, and tag management. Users also demonstrated a desire to have more control over the modules, on the dashboard and the post edit screen, for example.

The usability testing report says the following:

> In addition to a laundry list of small interface issues that presented simple fixes, such as changing comment author links, we were faced with larger issues such as the desire for user-determined hierarchies on long/scrolling screens, ambiguity in the Write/Manage navigation paradigm, and a disconnect between the act of adding media to a post and the ability to manage it.

While minor changes were incorporated into the Test1515 prototype and tested, they were so minor that participants didn't have a strong reaction either way. It was instead decided to use the results from Round 1 of testing to create a more drastic prototype, with the following guiding principles:
- maximise vertical space
- reduce scrolling
- increase access to navigation to reduce unnecessary screen loads
- enable drag and drop on screens that would most benefit from user control
- redesign management screens to take advantage of natural gaze paths.

<img alt="Crazyhorse sketches and navigation planning" src="../../Resources/images/design/crazyhorse-process.jpg" />

Jen and Liz, who had been asked by Matt to join the work on Crayhorse, went to work creating a prototype. They had sketched ideas based on front-end ending, one with accordion panes, one with a top navigation. In the end the version that they picked for the prototype was the simplest - a left hand navigation panel, much like Google Analytics and other web apps were doing.

A branch was made in Subversion where WordPress [developers built the prototype](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2008-June/020652.html), [based on a prototype document](http://ma.tt/dropbox/2008/06/wordpress-prototype-1.1.pdf) that outlined the changes and the reasons for them. The focus of the project was on user experience and functional development, so the prototype kept the same visual styles as WordPress 2.5. As with the previous round of testing, the participants carried out a series of tasks and the progress was assessed using talk-aloud, Morae, and eye tracking. The findings were striking.

Most responses demonstrated a preference for Crazyhorse over WordPress 2.5. Every new feature that was tested provided actionable information for the next version of WordPress. 

For example, participants loved new position of the navigation - at the left hand side of the screen. They also preferred the object-oriented approach to organisation (Posts, Pages, Media, etc). 

<img alt="Crazyhorse write screen prototype" src="../../Resources/images/design/crazyhorse-prototype-dashboard.jpg" />

The new Dashboard was considered more useful, and people liked the opportunity to be able to customize it to their own needs. They liked the idea of QuickPress, though they weren't sure if they would use it. With action links now positioned under the comments, users found it easier to edit and act on comments. 

<img alt="Crazyhorse write screen prototype" src="../../Resources/images/design/crazyhorse-prototype.jpg" />

The new Write screen enabled users to decide which elements to give the best screen real estate (using the drag-and-drop functionality). They also liked having access to post comments and felt that the new media uploader was a huge improvement, and better integrated in the media library.

<img alt="The bottom publish bar in the crazyhorse prototype" src="../../Resources/images/design/crazyhorse-prototype-publish.jpg" />

The only major negative responses were to a bottom bar that contained the functionality previously contained in the Publish module. Users tended to look at the bar a few times before realising that it contained the Publish button, with some users comparing it to a banner ad or the Chrome browser. 

Both Happy Cog and Crazyhorse had undertaken user research, but they ended up with quite different results. For Happy Cog, Liz conducted a series of interviews with community members, while later on she carried out in-person user testing. The Crazyhorse project, however, made use of eye tracking technology. This meant that the testers didn't have to rely solely on what participants said; instead they had insight into what the participants were looking at while they were making statements. Not only that, but gaze trails provided insight into the way that users were navigating the screen with their eyes - where were they drawn to first, were they missing important UI elements, did they understand what they were seeing?

With the success of the prototypes, the next stage was to put a design layer on top. When Crazyhorse was [first merged with trunk](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/7552) it was still simply a set of live wireframes. No design changes had been made so that participants in the testing wouldn't be swayed by whether they had a preference for a particular colour or typeface. But by the time of the Automattic meetup in Breckenridge, Colorado, in 2008, Crazyhorse was ready to have some colour added. 

At Automattic meetups, the company tends to split up into small groups to work on projects which are assigned at the beginning of the week. Everyone was given their assignments, and for Matt Miklic, MT, ([iammattthomas](http://profiles.wordpress.org/iammattthomas)) [2] his assignment was redesigning WordPress. He was given Crazyhorse and free reign to give it the coat of paint it needed. The rest of the week, Jen and MT spent the entire week working on the admin redesign. A number of designs were produced - a heavy blue that harked back to the Shuttle-inspired version of WordPress, and a version that used the light blue, greys, and orange of Happy Cog. In the end the two were melded into a grey colour scheme that became a feature of WordPress until 2013.

Effort was put in by Jen to ensure that the community was kept abreast of what was going on with the Crazyhorse project. The testing was carried out as an adjunct to the WordPress project, with little community involvement; the reason for the testing was to see if there was an actual usability flaw or whether people simply didn't like the new design. If it had been just a matter of users not liking the new colours, the Crazyhorse project would have come to nothing. But when it became obvious that the WordPress interface did need to change, a dialogue was started in the community. The [designs were shared on the development blog](http://wordpress.org/news/2008/10/the-visual-design-of-27/), as was the [usability report](http://wordpress.org/news/2008/10/usability-testing-report-25-and-crazyhorse/), a [survey was carried out about the navigation options](http://wordpress.org/news/2008/09/wordpress-27-navigation-options-survey/), and [issues were discussed on the wp-hackers mailing list](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2008-October/021944.html). In fact, when WordPress 2.7 was released, the [release post](http://wordpress.org/news/2008/12/coltrane/) lists all of the posts written by Jen and the developers about the process. Up to that point, it was the only iteration of the WordPress admin to have such an information trail.

In 2008 alone the WordPress admin changed drastically, twice. When [screenshots of the changes made their way onto community blogs](http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2008/09/02/first-look-at-wordpress-27/), the inevitable question was "why are they changing it again?" No time had allowed to let the WordPress 2.5 design really settle in before another huge change came about in 2.7. A change in the UI meant that users of varying skill levels needed to completely relearn how to use WordPress. Not only that, but there was a growing community of people who had created tutorials with screenshots and videos on how to use WordPress. Every screenshot would need to be retaken, every video re-shot. However, when WordPress users started upgrading the [feedback was positive](http://lorelle.wordpress.com/2008/12/10/wordpress-27-available-now/#comments). Unlike with WordPress 2.5, users loved the new interface, finding it easy to use and intuitive, and demonstrating finally that it wasn't change they had been unhappy with just nine months earlier, but the interface itself.

<img alt="The write screen in the WordPress 2.7 admin" src="../../Resources/images/design/2_7_admin.jpg" />

Incremental changes have been made over the years. [PHPDocumentor was added in WordPress 2.7](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-docs/2008-October/001769.html), when there was a big push by Jacob Santos and Jennifer Hodgdon to get functions in WordPress documented in the code. There was also a push in WordPress 2.7 to [create an official user handbook](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-docs/2009-January/001862.html).
In WordPress 2.7 the plugin repository was made available to WordPress users through the WordPress admin. They no longer had to download a plugin and upload it using FTP. A user could search the plugin directly for the features they needed right from their admin, and install the plugin with just a few clicks. This made it much easier for WordPress users to quickly find and install plugins, removing the barrier to entry that came with having to have knowledge of FTP.	

As other theme sellers waited to see if Revolution's shift to the GPL had any impact, things were brought to a head by WordPress.org. Just before Christmas 2008, without warning,[200 themes were pulled from the WordPress theme repository](https://web.archive.org/web/20090212220653/http://spectacu.la/wordpressorg-pull-200-gpl-themes). This didn't just provoke outrage amongst premium theme developers but [amongst the wider community](https://web.archive.org/web/20090315162659/http://www.jeffro2pt0.com/why-were-200-wordpress-themes-removed). What was the problem with theme authors selling their themes? Again, people conflated the actions of WordPress.org with Automattic and the company came under fire. The removal of themes from WordPress.org was seen as a sign that Automattic didn't want them making any money. The rhetoric got nasty. There [were claims](http://justintadlock.com/archives/2008/12/11/automattic-putting-the-boot-to-premium-theme-developers#comment-68674) that Automattic wanted every theme to be released for free so that the company could get its hands on them. Matt was accused of being a hypocrite and [of carrying out a jihad against premium theme sellers](http://www.inquisitr.com/11963/more-hypocrisy-from-mullenweg-and-wordpress-with-new-themes-jihad/).

While Automattic was coming under fire, the mood within the company was curiosity as opposed to antagonism. It was interesting for the company behind WordPress.com to see if people would actually pay for a new design for their blog. After all, Matt had abortively launched the WordPress.com marketplace and people within the company were still pushing for that to happen. Noël Jackson, [noel](http://profiles.wordpress.org/noel), a former Automattic employee, recalls the time when premium WordPress themes started appearing:
> It was interesting, especially in the beginning when it started happening. It was interesting to see revenue figures for themes that were released as a premium theme -- not a WordPress.com premium theme -- but someone selling their theme and keeping the GPL license and thinking, "Well, people are actually buying this." There wasn't an issue with it. I think that made everybody happy.

Beyond the hyperbolic rhetoric, theme sellers weren't happy. They hadn't been given any warning that their themes would be pulled from the repository. Many of them released themes as a way of supporting the community and spent considerable time ensuring that their themes met the coding standards of the theme repository. They felt as though the rug had been pulled from underneath them: they'd done their best to comply with WordPress.org standards but the rules of the game had changed. 

An email from Matt did the rounds in the community: 

> Thanks for emailing me about the theme directory. The other day I noticed a ton of bad stuff had snuck in like lots of spammy SEO links, themes whose sites said you couldn't modify them (which is a violation of the GPL), etc. Exactly the sort of stuff the theme directory was meant to avoid.

> There were also a few that violated WP community guidelines, like the domain policy. So since Monday we've been clearing stuff out en mass. If you're kosher with the GPL and don't claim or promote otherwise on your site and your theme was removed, it was probably a mistake. Give us a week to catch up with the bad stuff and then drop a note.

> Thanks guys, and let me know if you have any more questions.

However, the email did little to alleviate concerns. For most people, the email didn't tell them anything and some felt that it came across as blasé.

In a [podcast on WeblogToolsCollection](http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2008/12/19/2hr-interview-with-matt-mullenweg/), Matt discussed at length his position on the premium theme market ([transcription](http://www.wpsnippets.com/2008/12/transcript-of-wordpress-weeklys-interview-with-matt-mullenweg-december-2008-part-1/). In the interview, he describes how he was updating a friend's website which led him to start looking for WordPress themes in the directory. When he started looking he found themes with SEO links or linked to SEO sites, the behaviour that the theme directory had been set up to avoid. This led the team at WordPress.org to ask whether they wanted to allow GPL themes in the repository that seemed to serve as advertisements for non-GPL themes elsewhere. Their answer was no. 

In the interview, Matt makes clear that certain distinctions ought to be made. When it comes to "premium" themes, the word "proprietary" makes more sense as it doesn't make a value judgement that themes that cost money are better than those that don't. In a discussion about licensing, "proprietary" is more accurate than "commercial" or "premium" to distinguish a theme from a GPL theme, because GPL themes, such as Brian Gardner's Revolution, can be commercial.

> I love what Revolution has done, where they say 'Ok, so we still sold the theme, and we still bundle the support and everything like that with it, but it's also available as GPL.' So they're able to, within the GPL framework, create a business and respect the underlying license of the community that they are building on top of.

Most importantly, in the interview he makes it clear that theme developers are free to do what they want on their site, but that the WordPress project is equally free to do what it wants on WordPress.org, and that includes whether it should or should not promote businesses that sell non-GPL WordPress products. Part of the aim of the theme and plugin repositories are to promote theme and plugin developers. What the project didn't want to do was to promote theme and plugin developers who followed the license just to get on WordPress.org but who then violated WordPress' license elsewhere. Therefore, theme sellers who sold non-GPL products outside of WordPress.org would not be promoted on the site.

What the interview did do was provide a clear statement of what WordPress.org would and would not support. Even if people didn't like it they had their answer. The storm calmed and cleared the way for 2009, when businesses started to embrace the GPL.

In the months following the debate, discussions happened behind closed doors about how a business could be sustainable with the GPL. As the first to embrace the GPL, Brian Gardner provided advice to other premium theme sellers. In April 2009, [Spectacu.la](https://web.archive.org/web/20090619172730/http://spectacu.la/were-going-100-gpl/), the theme shop that first posted about themes being removed from the repo, announced that they were going fully GPL. They was followed in June by [iThemes](http://ithemes.com/2009/06/11/ithemes-is-going-gpl/) and and [WooThemes](https://web.archive.org/web/20100309084201/http://www.woothemes.com/2009/06/woothemes-gpled). 

A site of regular debates was WP Tavern, run by Jeff Chandler, who had formerly written at WLTC. 	

As well as being a community blog, WP Tavern ran parallel forums where the community could discuss current issues. It was here that some of the community's most heated debates happened. 	
The most heated of all was a big community argument around the issue of the data that WordPress collects from websites and sends back to WordPress.org, often described as "phoning home".

Add something about Matt later buying WP Tavern & WLTC

Attempts are regularly made to improve communication in the project. By 2009, central communication in the project had fragmented into a number of different places: Trac, wp-hackers, the #wordpress-dev IRC chat room, [wpdevel.wordpress.com](http://make.wordpress.org/core/page/121/) that was set up in 2008 and used for development updates, and the development blog on WordPress.org. A [post written by Jen Mylo in 2009](https://wordpress.org/news/2009/05/ideas/) highlights the state of each of WordPress' primary communication channels: the #wordpress-dev channel had become mostly inactive, wp-hackers had thousands of subscribers but it often became a forum for troubleshooting, the [development blog](http://wordpress.org/news/) was largely a place for official announcements, the [wpdevel.wordpress.com](http://make.wordpress.org/core/) blog (directed now to http://make.wordpress.org/core) was a place for the core team to post what they were working on, trac had become an an unworkable mess with hundreds of tickets lined up for future versions that weren't even relevant anymore, and the ideas forum where anyone could suggest a new feature, but that had highly-voted but irrelevant threads featured highly.	

A [thread was opened up to discuss improvements to communication](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/ideas-forumcommunication-channels?replies=55). There were a number of suggestions for improvements:  that there be somewhere for people to raise things other than trac, to find a way for make it easier for people to write automated unit tests, that the community be able to vote on ideas, that documentation be better integrated into WordPress and trac, that P2 be used for discussion, or that BuddyPress (a social-networking plugin that is a sister-project to WordPress) be used on WordPress.org	

But in addition to suggestions, there were a number of complaints: that no one official reads the ideas forum, IRC meet ups were difficult for people to attend because of timezone differences, that there were too many channels of communication - far too much for people to keep up with. 	

There were also complaints about the governance of the community. Some felt that there was no transparency about how things were run. As [Jen responded](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/ideas-forumcommunication-channels/page/2?replies=55#post-1071517), "Your post just proves the point that communication is an issue. I would not say that WP lacks a clear direction, I would say that it simply hasn't been communicated properly."	

Part of the intention for the post, and for a lot of work that Jen was doing at the time, was to make it clear how decisions were made in project. It wasn't uncommon for people to come into the IRC chat and throw in feature requests, and it was more helpful if people knew the correct channels for asking questions and requesting features.	

The benefit of using WordPress trac for discussion was that it focused discussion directly on a trac ticket which was opened to report a bug, feature, or enhancement. That said, as wp-hackers mailing list members caught on to the fact that the important discussions were happening on trac, it became just as susceptible to intractable discussions. 	


Trac has been the site of a recurrent bike shed discussion, around the issue of smilies. In 2009, [a ticket was opened up to replace](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/10145) WordPress' smilies with Tango/Gnome smilies. The patch was [committed by Ryan Boren](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/11685)	

<img src="../../Resources/community/smilies.jpg" width="800px" />

The first place that the smilies landed was WordPress.com, which receives daily updates to the codebase. The [feedback wasn't good](http://en.forums.wordpress.com/topic/new-smilies?replies=84), and reaction on the trac ticket spiralled, with contributors unhappy that the changes to the smilies had been added to core without any discussion. The problem was that WordPress [changed users' content](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/10145#comment:18), without giving them any say in it. Some users would be unhappy if, upon updating their website, their content was changed. The discussion moved from trac tickets and spread out onto [community blogs](http://wptavern.com/nothing-to-smile-about), with calls, as is often the case with bike shed discussions, for a public poll.	

Ryan Boren eventually [reverted the change](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/10145#comment:28) with the comment: "Back to the prehistoric smilies that everyone complains about but evidently likes better. :-) I was a fool for not appreciating the explosive topic that is smilies, my bad."	

The smiley debate was reignited in 2014, when WordPress.com updated its emoticons and a proposal was made to [produce high-dpi smilies for use on retina displays](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24970). Yet again, the arguments were brought out, and [spread once again to community blogs ](http://wptavern.com/wordpress-smiley-wars-will-core-adopt-new-emoticons). As of May 2014, the smilies have still not been updated.	

WordCamps haven't been without their problems. In the beginning, interested people would just decide to organise a WordCamp. They would contact Maya, who was doing admin at Automattic at the time, who would send out stickers, buttons and other swag. In 2009, [WordPress.com blog was set up for WordCamp organisers](http://wordcamphowto.wordpress.com/2009/06/26/hello-welcome-to-this-super-blog/) to communicate with one another.
 In addition to the user handbook, [Jen Mylo posted to the wp-docs mailing list in August 2009](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-docs/2009-August/002034.html) about a series of handbooks for tackling different aspects of WordPress - theme development, plugin development, for example. A [trac instance was set up](http://docs.trac.wordpress.org/), along with a [wordpress.com blog for managing the handbooks](http://wphandbook.wordpress.com/). These projects, however, didn't get very far, and aborted handbook projects have started and stopped since 2009. In 2014, two projects are in progress to complete the theme and plugin developer handbooks.	


There have also [been discussions about creating a WordPress developer portal](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2009-December/029264.html).
In December 2009, the team of core committers - Matt, Mark, Ryan, Westi, Andrew - along with Jen, met in Orlando for the first time. It was the first time that some of them had met in person, despite having worked together on the project for a number of years. They spent a few days there [discussing things that were live issues in the project](https://wordpress.org/news/2009/12/intermission/) - "the merge, canonical plugins, the WordPress.org site, community stuff, and all the other things that are important but that we never seem to have time to address." The aim was to get together and talk about the goals and the vision of the project. For the duration of the meetup, they worked from the hotel lobby at the Bohemian Hotel in Orlando. As well as discussing their goals they had a trac sprint that edged them closer to shipping WordPress 2.9.	

The first of the results posts, [posted to the WordPress news blog](http://wordpress.org/news/2009/12/core-team-meetup-results/ highlights the breadth of the discussion: 	

> Direction for the coming year(s), canonical plugins, social i18n for plugins, plugin salvage (like UDRP for abandoned plugins), WordPress/MU merge, default themes, CMS functionality (custom taxonomies, types, statuses, queries), cross-content taxonomy, media functions and UI, community "levels" based on activity, defining scope of releases, site menu management, communications within the community, lessons learned from past releases, mentorship programs, Trac issues, wordpress.org redesign, documentation, community code of conduct.	

These types of meetups have continued to be a feature of core development, with members of the development team meeting up at WordCamps or at dedicated meetups to have code sprints and to discuss the direction of the project. These have been everything from small focused meetups of the core team, to large meetups involving the whole community.	

Despite the positive benefits to meeting up in person, having in-person meetups isn't without consequences. Not everyone can always be at a meetup, some people can't take time away from their job or their family, some have health problems that mean they can't travel. "One of the beautiful things about WordPress is that it's a meritocracy, so you could be from anywhere in the world with any sort of economic, social, or mobility background, and be able to contribute," says Matt. "I so like the idea that you could be one of the lead people without ever meeting one of the existing people, but the reality today is if you wanted to be one of the lead people you really do need to go to WordCamps and socialize and everything like that. It's better in some ways and it's worse in others, but it is worth recognizing that that's the current reality."	
One of the initiatives discussed at the meetup was core plugins. The number of plugins in the WordPress repository was growing, and many of them did the same thing. Some of them didn't have very good quality of code, some were out of date. There were lots of big plugins that were large and complex and that transformed what WordPress could do. Sometimes the plugins were dropped by the developer and with no one taking care of them any more the users were stuck. The core development team felt that some plugins warranted a similar development process to the development process in core - a group of developers would lead the development of a plugin, deciding what went in and what didn't, in a similar way to how WordPress, BuddyPress, and bbPress are developed. Rather than having ten SEO plugins, or ten podcasting plugins, for example, there would be one canonical plugin, sanctioned by core with its own official development team.	

WordPress' core development team were firmly behind the proposal, and [Jen posted about it on the news blog](http://wordpress.org/news/2009/12/canonical-plugins/).  In the post, she talks about the strong relationship between WordPress core and canonical plugins. This would ensure that plugin code was secure, had the best possible example of coding standards, and new versions of WordPress would be tested against the plugins to ensure compatibility. As is often the case in WordPress, much of the early discussion was around what to call the thing, rather than the thing itself.	

Having decided on the designation "core plugins", a team that included Westi, Aaron Campbell ([aaroncampbell](http://profiles.wordpress.org/aaroncampbell, Austin Matzko ([filosofo](http://profiles.wordpress.org/filosofo)), Stephen Rider ([Strider72](http://profiles.wordpress.org/Strider72)), and Pete Mall ([PeteMall](http://profiles.wordpress.org/PeteMall/)), started work, with Peter from the core development team helping with infrastructure and processes.	

The project, however, was beset by problems, and despite all of the coverage that it got in the WordPress community, it fizzled out before it went anywhere. While there was potential in the project, there weren't tools available for working effectively across a broad group of plugins. "We didn't have the toolset at the time to do it properly," says Aaron Campbell, "without stepping outside of the WordPress ecosystem quite a bit and relying on something like a GitHub or something like that, which we prefer not to rely on for things that are really kind of the core of WordPress."	

When the plugin repository was built it was designed with one author per plugin, without tools for developers to collaborate by sending pull requests. While the plugin repository has become more flexible (it's now possible, for example, to have multiple authors per plugin), it's not got all of the tools that developers are becoming accustomed to. To have multiple developers working on the same thing there needs to be a system to pass contributions in, discuss patches, modify patches, and merge them. To develop WordPress, there have been tools built around the subversion repository to make that possible, and the modified trac instance encourages collaboration. But for each core plugin would need a replica of the infrastructure that WordPress used itself, and it became obvious that the plan was untenable.	

The other problem was that while the project wanted plugin developers to collaborate with each other, they didn't want to. Plugin developers liked having ownership over their own plugins. There was also politics amongst plugin developers who were upset that someone else's plugin would be chosen over their own. 	

To add to these problems, many of the developers were burnt out from WordPress 2.9 and were taking a break with the promise of a major release cycle in WordPress 3.0. They didn't have the energy or time to commit to building core plugins as well as developing the core product itself. 	

The issue was re-opened in 2009 on the WP Tavern forums by Lynne Pope, [who also posted to wp-hackers](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2009-December/029083.htm). Lynne pointed out that Matt had said that the situation with regards to data collection would be reviewed in WordPress 2.5, and asked whether WordPress had found a need to collect blog URLs. In the discussion thread on WP Tavern, Lynne went further into her concerns: [link?}	

>  wordpress.org is not a legal entity so there is nobody to sue if data is misused. You can't sue a community. There is no disclosure about what data is collected or how it will be used. People are just supposed to trust that volunteers working on an open source project can be relied upon to keep personal data private?	

She also made [reference to WordPress.org being cracked in March 2007](http://wordpress.org/news/2007/03/upgrade-212/), making the point that if someone were to again crack WordPress.org they would have access to all of that data.	

Since much of the data was freely available on the internet already, many people were unconcerned about the collection, but Lynne made the point that what isn't available easily is the totality of that information.	

Opponents felt that it was unnecessary for WordPress to collect the blog URL information, as it isn't necessary to carry out update checks.	

Mark Jaquith, who had originally opposed the data collection, [responded to Lynne on wp-hackers](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2009-December/029089.html):	
> The more I thought about it, the more my knee-jerk objections faded away. Your server is doing an HTTP request, so the server knows your server's IP address. You can figure out what blog domains are hosted	on that IP with a search on Bing or several other search engines. So if WordPress.org really wanted to know your URL, it could find it. Again, that's just based on the IP address, which you HAVE to send for HTTP to work. If your URL is discoverable, and your IP address has to be sent, withholding the URL doesn't actually get you more privacy, ultimately.	

Much of the discussion about phoning home took place away from wp-hackers, with the bulk of it taking place on the WP Tavern blog and forums The phoning home  thread generated 291 responses and was the most popular post on the forum. It was also [heavily discussed on WeblogToolsCollection](http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2009/12/10/is-wordpress-spyware/) under a post from Jeff Chandler titled "Is WordPress spyware?"	

The issue on [WordPress trac was reopened for discussion](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5066#comment:23), and [was mooted for the development chat](http://make.wordpress.org/core/2009/12/10/suggest-agenda-items-for-dec-17th-dev-ch/#comment-1030) - some community members felt that their concerns around privacy were valid and felt that [Matt failed to be taking them seriously](http://make.wordpress.org/core/2009/12/10/suggest-agenda-items-for-dec-17th-dev-ch/#comment-1042). He did, however, clarify in the thread that WordPress.org only stored the latest update sent but no historical data. Historical data was only held in aggregate so that statistics could be provided for plugin and theme developers.	

Mark Jaquith, who had originally opposed the data collection, joined in the discussion on WP Tavern to say why he had changed his mind when it came to objecting to data collection:	
- an IP address, which must be sent by the server, is not significantly more anonymous than a URL	
- URLs allow WordPress to verify the identity of a blog. When URLs are hashed it's no longer possibly to verify the blog identity leaving systems that involve plugin rankings based on usage or popularity to be gamed.	
- the privacy policy was updated to cover api.wordpress.org	

The lead developers are also opposed to adding new options to enable people to opt-in or opt-out of the data collection. "decisions, not options," is a cornerstone of the WordPress ethos. As lead developer Peter Westwood said in the 2007 discussion around data collection:	

> One of the core design ideas for WordPress is that we don't introduce options lightly. The moment you think of making a feature optional you challenge the argument for introducing the feature in the beginning.	
And then there was the trademark. They couldn't countenance a big company acquiring the trademark for the open source project.  They couldn't just give it to Matt, because having the trademark owned by just one person wasn't the right solution. Instead the decision was made to put the trademark in a Foundation that could own it and make sure that it remained protected. "The WordPress trademark had started out under the ownership of Automattic, with always being the intention that it would be transferred to the WordPress Foundation," says early investor Phil Black.	As part of that donation, Automattic was given rights to use the trademark, but just for WordPress.com, not for anything else. They can't start up any new ventures with the name "WordPress" in them. 		

In January 2010, the website for the WordPress Foundation was launched, and [later that year the trademarks were transferred to the Foundation](http://ma.tt/tag/wordpress-foundation/).		
WordPress 3.0 saw changes to the development process. For this release, the team set a deadline to launch on April 13 2010. 	
But as with the releases before it, WordPress 3.0 was focused around the scope, not around the date. The headline features were discussed with the aim of getting them done by a specific date. At the [scope setting chat](https://irclogs.wordpress.org/chanlog.php?channel=wordpress-dev&day=2010-01-07#m51679) three main features were defined: merging WordPress MU with WordPress, menus, and a new default theme to replace Kubrick. 	

At WordCamp San Francisco Matt announced that WordPress MU would be merged with WordPress. This was for a number of reasons - WordPress MU was difficult to maintain. The code was 95% the same and Donncha had to manually merge over new features after a release. WordPress MU was difficult to maintain - it just had one person really taking care of it and it wasn't always possible for him to merge all of core's changes into WPMU.  Also, WordPress MU wasn't getting a lot of attention from plugin developers - it felt separate to the main WordPress project.	

This also happened around the time that the name WPMU had been co-opted by business-owner James Farmer who had registered wpmu.org. This caused confusion around the name, so it seemed like a good time to rename it as well.	

Rather than simply adding multisite functionality to core, merging WordPress MU with WordPress meant that WordPress MU users would have a clean upgrade path to the next version - no one would be left languishing on an outdated piece of software that might end up being forked.	

A new committer was brought on board to assist with the merge. Ron Rennick had been using WordPress MU for a number of years for the homeschooling blogging network that he ran with his wife, Andrea.	

He had already written a script which ran on a WordPress install which would turn it in to a WordPress MU install. This meant he was able to reverse engineer his script to bring MU functionality into WordPress, ensuring that there was a utility to convert a single WorDPress install to a Multisite install.	

It was Ron's job to run a diff against all of the WordPress MU code, look for differences in the codebase and [merge that into WordPress core](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/11644). The code was then cleaned up by Ryan Boren and Andrew Nacin. Ron also worked on additional functionality that was absent from WordPress MU and that there were as yet no plans to bring in to core like [domain mapping](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-mu-domain-mapping/) functionality, for example.	

There were tweaks to the development process, however, that would be continued on into later releases. One of these was giving commit access to developers for specific components. Ron Rennick was given commit access to carry out the multisite merge, and Andrew Nacin and Dion Hulse were given commit access shortly afterwards. 	
Originally, WordPress users were able to upgrade to WordPress Multisite by just clicking a button. "The reason we decided not to do that," recalls Ron,  "is that a lot of the shared hosts would not have been happy if they're users could just take any WordPress install, click a button, without actually knowing anything about what was going to happen and convert it over to Multisite.  The decision was made to actually make it a physical process that they had to go through." In order to change a WordPress installation into Multisite, WordPress users have to edit wp-config, which means they have to have some minimum technical knowledge.	

One of the biggest headache surrounding the merge wasn't to do with code, but was rather to do with terminology. In WordPress 3.0, a decision was made to do away with the "blog"  terminology and instead refer to a WordPress installation as a "site".  As WordPress had grown, more and more people were using it as a CMS so the "site" label felt more appropriate. However, in WordPress MU, the parent - example.org - is a site, and the subdomain blog.example.org is a blog. With WordPress MU and WordPress to merge, which one was the site? An individual WordPress install, or a WordPress install that hosted many blogs? WordPress MU became WordPress Multisite, but that wasn't the end of it.	

WordPress MU had a function get_site_option, which gets options for the entire network, and get_blog_option which gets options for individual sites. The functions, therefore, don't relate entirely to the user interface. That was just one of the functions that caused them problems, [as Andrew Nacin outlined in a post on his blog](http://nacin.com/2010/03/25/terminology-nightmare-blogs-sites-networks/).	

The big user-facing feature for WordPress 3.0 was menus. At the time it wasn't easy for people to add navigation menus to their websites. There were a number of plugins but it was decided that this should be managed in core.	

The [ticket was opened at the start of January 2010](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/11817). The first approach to using it was to make the menus interface act much like the widgets interface. By mid-February, however, little progress had been made. There were a number of competing proposals for how menus should work and Ryan and Jen got in touch with WooThemes to discuss bringing their [custom woo navigation](http://www.woothemes.com/2010/01/the-awesome-custom-woo-navigation/) into WordPress core. This was just days before the planned feature freeze on 15th February. 	

The custom Woo navigation plugin was developed by WooThemes to make it easier for their users to add menus to their website. The developer, Jeffrey Pearce, was introduced to the core team and assigned to work with Ptah Dunbar. Work needed to be done on the plugin to get it ready for core, and to prepare core for the functionality. At the time, core didn't have the version of jQuery that Woo was using so jQuery was updated.  The original WooThemes plugin created new database tables for the menus. The WordPress development team tries not to add additional tables to the MySQL database. Instead, core developers used Custom Post Types, which let them make use of functionality already available with core.	

Not everything went smoothly. Ptah and Jeffrey struggled with a factor that every distributed FOSS project has to work with - time zones. Jeffrey is based in South Africa, while much of the core development work went on according to US time zones. The dev chats were at 20:30 UTC, which was 22:30 in South Africa. Additionally, Ptah and Jeffrey kept missing each other on Skype.	

An environment in which everyone had a a voice and an opinion wasn't something that WooThemes was used to within their own development process. Adii Pienaar, who was then CEO of WooThemes, described the process as excruciating. One of the main points of contention was that WooThemes had originally put the menus in the centre of the screen in the user interface, with the boxes to add menu items on the right hand side. WooThemes had put time into designing it that way but the [menu interface was flipped around](http://make.wordpress.org/core/2010/02/25/menus-ux-manifesto/) to follow the layout on WordPress' interface that has a left to right convention.	

The integration of WooTheme's menus into core was one of the first times that the project had worked directly with a commercial business (other than Automattic). While the process was not always completely smooth, both sides did benefit from the process. WordPress got its menu system. While not exactly the same as the menu system that WooThemes created, it gave the menus feature the kickstart that it was lacking. WooThemes got the satisfaction of seeing its code used by every WordPress user. [Not everyone felt that WooThemes received adequate credit](http://wptavern.com/woothemes-has-and-will-continue-to-get-credit), though this viewpoint wasn't shared by Jeff. "Just to have our name on the contributors' wall, that to me was good enough," he says. "It's nice just to be able to say, I built a part of WordPress. No one can ever take that away from me. That was recognition enough for me."	

WordPress 3.0 ended up being a huge release, and while discussion around menus was going on, shipping the product got delayed again and again.. By April, the core team was still sending around wireframes and [discussing whether menus should be pulled from 3.0](https://irclogs.wordpress.org/chanlog.php?channel=wordpress-dev&day=2010-04-15&sort=asc#m109848. The [release candidate kept being pushed back]http://make.wordpress.org/core/version-3-0-project-schedule/).   Matt posted on the development blog, [stating one of WordPress' key philosophies](http://make.wordpress.org/core/2010/04/20/deadlines-are-not-arbritrary-theyre-a/:	

> Deadlines are not arbitrary, they're a promise we make to ourselves and our users that helps us rein in the endless possibilities of things that could be a part of every release.	

As had often caused delays with WordPress, doing feature-led releases meant that there was delays to getting the product shipped. Menus caused the particular hold-up with WordPress 3.0, with huge amounts of prevaricating about the user interface and the implementation. The final release was packed full of features that included the new menus, WordPress Multisite merged with core, custom post types and taxonomies, custom background and headers, and there was a refresh of the admin colour scheme.
In addition to community blogs, a lot of the community's interaction happens on personal blogs. Ian Stewart's ThemeShaper, for example, was the locus for much of the debate around the GPL and Themes. A debate that was thrashed out in the comment thread of a personal blog was the discussion around the capital_P_dangit() function. Theme developer, Justin Tadlock [wrote about it on his blog and the post generated 139 comments](http://justintadlock.com/archives/2010/07/08/lowercase-p-dangit). 	

This issue, much like the discussion around smilies, was centred around WordPress changing a user's content. The function was written by Matt in 2010 and [committed by Andrew Nacin](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/14996). The function is a basic filter that replaces spellings of Wordpress with WordPress, ensuring that WordPress retains its CamelCase. 	

People felt that WordPress was messing with their content, and that transforming Wordpress into WordPress was the start of a slippery slope. For some, it was a form of overbearing pedantry, for others it constituted censorship. After all, if someone wanted to write Wordpress instead of WordPress, why shouldn't they? The principle of the matter was that WordPress had no business changing what people wanted to write. People who were unhappy with the change, saw this as incommensurable with the core freedoms of the project - [openness, freedom, and community](http://justintadlock.com/archives/2010/07/08/lowercase-p-dangit).	

A further issue was that, in order for a community member to have a patch in core, they would have to open a trac ticket, wait for discussion and feedback, and have the code reviewed prior to the patch being committed. When core developers could just circumvent this process, it upset members of the community.	

Not all core developers were happy with the change. [Andy Skelton posted to the mailing list to say](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2010-July/033007.html) "I know Matt well enough to predict the reasons for his intentions and to know that they are good and unselfish, even while opinionated and objectionable." In the same email, he also reiterates his unhappiness with the thread.	

A further problem was that in some instances the filter was breaking URLS. This was [reported prior to WordPress 3.0's release](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/13583), but because the filter had already worked well on WordPress.com, it wasn't fixed. For example, [a user reported on trac](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/13971) that his image, named "WordpressLogo_blue-m.png" was broken because it had been renamed to "WordPressLogo_blue-m.png". Upon upgrading to WordPress 3.0, other users, those with folders named Wordpress, [experienced the same problem](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/images-not-appearing-3?replies=30#post-1559585). As well as folders, URLs with the spelling Wordpress were broken. Hosts saw an uptick in support request. "When 3.0 arrived," says Mike Schroder, of Dreamhost, "we had a deluge of support with broken URLs due to capital_P_dangit() applying to all content.  This was a particular problem because it was popular among customers to use '/wordpress' as a subdirectory for their install. We helped customers with temporary workarounds in the meantime, but were very happy to see the issue fixed in 3.0.1." Mark Jaquith [added a fix](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/13971#comment:15), but for many contributors it should never had got to the point at which the WordPress software was breaking users' websites.	

The capital_P_dangit function isn't the only function in WordPress to filter content. Other filters include emoticons, autop, shortcodes, texturize, special characters, curly quotes, tag balancing, filtered HTML / kses, and comment link nofollows.	
The argument was that changing Wordpress to WordPress didn't actually change the meaning of the sentence, except in edge cases such as the sentence "Wordpress is the incorrect capitalisation of WordPress."	

Some felt that the discussion was becoming an unnecessary [attack on Matt](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2010-July/032969.html). And the [core developers became frustrated](http://justintadlock.com/archives/2010/07/08/lowercase-p-dangit#comment-211354) by the hyperbole around the inclusion of the filter and by the amount of words spent arguing about it. In a comment in a post on Justin Tadlock's blog, Mark Jaquith left the following comment:	

> Calling corrections* censorship is absurd. It is no less absurd when the capitalization of a single letter is called censorship. There is actual censorship going on all around the world at this very moment. I'm damn proud of the fact that WordPress is being used to publish content that makes governments around the world afraid of the citizens who publish it. I'm incredulous that people are making a fuss about a single character (which is only one of dozens of automatic corrections that WordPress makes). It's free software that is easily extended (or crippled) by plugins. If the thought of going the rest of your life without misspelling WordPress it too much to bear, you have an easy out. Take it, take a deep breath, and try to pick your battles."	
[A website that Mark put together](http://capitalp.org/), reflects the position of many of the core developers about the capital_P_dangit discussion.	

<img src="../../Resources/community/capital_p_dangit.png.jpg" width="800px" />

While this had all of the [hallmarks of a bikeshed](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2010-July/032919.html), there were some procedural issues that community members felt ought to be taken seriously. Whether the WordPress software capitalised the P in WordPress or not, the method with which they were added to core broke accepted procedure - no ticket was opened, no patch was uploaded to trac, the code was simply committed. For some this set up an us and them mentality whereby some core developers could commit code as they felt, whereas everyone else in the community was subject to a different process.	

Since WordCamps were so informal, there was no ensuring that they were running properly. Many WordCamps ran without budgets, despite being events that had a lot of money running through them. There were situations in which organisers would take some of the money for themselves. Another WordCamp was launched, with registration, just so that the organiser could compile a mailing list to which they could send marketing emails. A WordCamp was set up, they took sponsorship money, and then never ran the WordCamp and never gave back the sponsorship money. [confirming these with AM]	

It was clear that WordCamps needed to be better monitored, with guidelines and someone to oversee them. The first person to [take this on was Jen Mylo](http://wordcamphowto.wordpress.com/2010/05/19/fyi-im-taking-over-as-central-liaison/). In her announcement post, she makes reference to the fact that WordCamps bear the official seal of approval of WordPress, and, as such, they should only promote WordPress products that are GPL-compliant. This meant no one could speak, organise or volunteer at a WordCamp if they sold or promoted a WordPress product that wasn't 100% GPL. 	

In some quarters, [the changes went down badly](http://onefinejay.com/2010/05/19/a-few-questions-on-jane-wells-revised-wordcamp-policies). Others [took a calmer look at it](http://www.bloggingpro.com/archives/2010/05/19/wordcamps-need-to-be-gpl-too-now/) but they, too, asked why people who promoted non-GPL products would be banned from speaking. This all happened shortly before things came to a head with Thesis and Chris Pearson. While many of the WordPress theme shops were 100% GPL, some hadn't followed suit and were indignant that they would have to do so just to speak at a WordCamp.	

Jen published [the first version of the WordCamp guidelines](https://web.archive.org/web/20100723003529/http://central.wordcamp.org/about/). They were that WordCamps should:	
- be about WordPress 
- be open to all, easy to access, shared with the community 
- locally organised and focused 
- volunteer-driven 
- stand alone events 
- promoting WordPress' philosophy 
- not be about making money	

The [guidelines have been refined over the years](http://plan.wordcamp.org/become-an-organizer/representing-wordpress/), particularly in relation to community feedback. While not everyone remains happy about them, they have not prevented WordCamps from flourishing across the world.	

As well as being events that allow WordPress users to learn about WordPress, they are places where the contributor community comes together. 2013 onwards saw an increase in WordCamps holding contributor days. A contributor day is an event, usually attached to a WordCamp (but not always) at which people can learn how to get involved with the project. For some people, this is their first taste of contributing. For others it's a way to get together to work through tickets or discuss new features. While the WordPress community is used to working together online, meeting face-to-face has added another dimension to relationships.	

With both the theme and plugin directory open for submissions, they both eventually needed a team to review the code coming in. The first to be set up was the WordPress Theme Review Team. This was in 2010, around a year after the theme directory had been launched. Joseph Scott posted on the news blog. He wrote: 	

> The theme directory has been chugging along for more than a year now. During that time we've tinkered with the review process and some of the management tools, but haven't really opened it up as much as we'd like. It's time to rip off the band-aid and take some action; to that end, we're looking for community members to help with the process of reviewing themes for the directory.	

There was a [rush of people who signed up for the new mailing list](http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/theme-reviewers/2010-June/), and a [set of guidelines was drawn up](http://codex.wordpress.org/index.php?title=Theme_Review&oldid=91889). Not everyone was happy with the guidelines, however. There were complaints that they were too restrictive and that it took far too long for themes to be reviewed. For those who had been writing themes for years, they felt that some of the theme requirements should instead be recommendations. On the WP Tavern forums, Justin Tadlock outlined some of the problems, including the fact that the guidelines didn't allow for themes with custom template hierarchies or custom image systems. Some people felt that the theme review team should restrict itself to looking for spam and other objectionable practices. 	

Developers were frustrated that themes were being rejected on the basis of minor issues. Otto wrote on the WP Tavern forum, "A rejection for such minor things should simply *never* happen. Tell the developer about it. Work with them, send them explanations why these are issues. But a summary rejection for nothing is just freakin' stupid." Other developers simply decided to [remove their themes from the directory](http://quirm.net/2010/08/27/retiring-themes/).	

For those reviewing the themes, there were problems, particularly with manpower. The theme review queue was backed up with 100 themes in July 2010, and ten new themes are being added every day. Only 3-4 people were actively reviewing themes.	

Over time, some of the processes have been automated and tools have been created to help with the theme review process. One is the [theme check plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-check/) which tests the theme against all of the latest theme review standards.	

In July, Matt announced that he had been in contact with the Software Freedom Law Centre which [provided its opinion on theme licensing](http://wordpress.org/news/2009/07/themes-are-gpl-too/): 
> the WordPress themes supplied contain elements that are derivative of WordPress's copyrighted code. These themes, being collections of distinct works (images, CSS files, PHP files), need not be GPL-licensed as a whole. Rather, the PHP files are subject to the requirements of the GPL while the images and CSS are not. Third-party developers of such themes may apply restrictive copyrights to these elements if they wish.

Following that announcement, more theme sellers adopted the license, though not all went 100% GPL (including CSS, images, and Javascript). Envato, for example, whose marketplace ThemeForest was growing in popularity, opted [for GPL compliance only with a split license](https://web.archive.org/web/20090819130204/http://blog.themeforest.net/site-news/important-change-to-wordpress-license-takes-effect-today-please-read) in which the PHP was GPL but the additional files were proprietary.
There was one theme that held out against the GPL. The Thesis Theme from DIYThemes was one of the most popular themes around. It was created by WordPress theme designer Chris Pearson and well-known blogger Brian Clark from Copyblogger. It was a functionality-heavy theme that gave users way more options than they had in most WordPress themes. WordPress users could use the user interface to customise every element of their website. On the original about page [Chris states the aim of Thesis](https://web.archive.org/web/20080610074529/http://diythemes.com/thesis/about/): "I wanted a framework that had it all--killer typography, a dynamically resizable layout, intelligent code, airtight optimization, and tons of flexibility." It was [featured on a number of tech blogs](http://thenextweb.com/2008/07/17/thesis-represents-the-next-generation-of-wordpress-themes/#!A2Baz) and adopted and endorsed by high-profile bloggers such as [Matt Cutts](http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/switching-things-around/), [Chris Brogan](http://www.chrisbrogan.com/thesis-wordpress-theme/), and [Darren Rowse](http://www.problogger.net/archives/2008/07/18/thesis-a-wordpress-theme-design-worth-considering/).

Chris Pearson was well-respected in the community, having already developed Cutline and PressRow before moving into the premium theme market with Thesis. Thesis itself was influential on theme development. A [post from mid-2009 on ThemeShaper talks about](http://themeshaper.com/2009/05/21/design-popular-wordpress-theme-chris-pearsons-secret/) "The Pearson Principle": "Bloggers want powerfully simple design on an equally robust framework." With themes such as Revolution and Premium News, theme developers were already moving into creating themes packed with functionality, but Thesis cemented that move. Simple design on the front-end with options for full website customisation. It was the era of the theme framework, when a theme framework had as much functionality as WordPress itself and the user was able to create a design to their own liking. [Chris called this](http://themeshaper.com/2009/05/21/design-popular-wordpress-theme-chris-pearsons-secret/comment-page-1/#comment-9718) "ubiquitous design" - a theme was no longer just a website skin but a tool for building your website. It would take another four years before theme developers would stop packing themes with options and start moving functionality into plugins.

While theme vendors adopted the GPL, Thesis held out. Discussions [happened between DIY Themes and Toni Schneider from Automattic](http://pomomusings.com/2009/06/04/switch-wordpress-blog/#comment-59022) about how the theme could become GPL compliant but no progress was made.  Relationships were already fractious between WordPress and DIY Themes. In June 2009, as discussions were going on between Brian and Toni, a blogger's comments thread was [hijacked](http://pomomusings.com/2009/06/04/switch-wordpress-blog/) for a long discussion about Thesis and the GPL. As was often the case, the debates happened in comments threads. Matt implored people to move away from Thesis, saying "if you care about the philosophical underpinnings of WordPress please consider putting your support behind something that isn't hostile to WordPress' core freedoms and GPL license."

For three weeks in July 2010, the debate between WordPress and Thesis exploded. All of the major tech news sites took notice. It started with an interview with [Chris Pearson on entrepreneur-interview website Mixergy](http://mixergy.com/chris-pearson-thesis-interview/). In it Chris is expansive on the revenue generated from Thesis, putting a conservative estimate at 1.2 million dollars within 16 to 18 months.  

Just over a week later and [Matt and Chris took to Twitter.](https://twitter.com/pearsonified/status/18536597161). Matt was unhappy that Chris was flaunting making so much money while violating WordPress' license. Cutting remarks were passed back and forth until Andrew Warner from Mixergy decided to get the two men in a virtual room. An [impromptu debate was set up and the issues were discussed live](http://mixergy.com/chris-pearson-matt-mullenweg/). The hour long discussion lays both sides out on the table. Matt argues that Thesis is built on GPL software, WordPress, and therefore should honour the license. By not doing so, he both disrespects all of the authors of WordPress and breaks the law. For Chris, adopting the GPL means giving up his rights and losing his protection from piracy. He argues that "what I've done stands alone outside of WordPress completely", and that Thesis "does not inherit anything from WordPress." The argument descends into a rambling discussion of economics, and ends in Matt saying that he's willing to sue Chris if he's not willing to comply with the GPL. 

Following the interview, more and more public action was taken against Thesis by Matt, Automattic, and WordPress. Matt [offered to buy Thesis users an alternative premium theme](https://twitter.com/photomatt/status/18548422506), consultants using Thesis were [removed from the Code Poet directory of WordPress consultants](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mg315/4792383313/), and Chris Pearson's other themes, Cutline and PressRow, were [removed from WordPress.com](http://www.pearsonified.com/2010/11/former-cutline-pressrow-theme-user.php). 

Matt wasn't the only person involved with WordPress to come out against Thesis. Other lead and core developers took to their own blogs to write about their stance on the GPL and Thesis. [Ryan Boren wrote](http://ryan.boren.me/2010/07/15/wordpress-theme-licensing/), "where do I stand as one of the primary copyright holders of WordPress?  I'd like to see the PHP parts of themes retain the GPL. Aside from preserving the spirit of WordPress, respecting the open source ecosystem in which it thrives, and avoiding questionable legal ground, retaining the GPL is practical." Mark Jaquith [wrote about how WordPress themes don't sit on top of WordPress](http://markjaquith.wordpress.com/2010/07/17/why-wordpress-themes-are-derivative-of-wordpress/) but are interdependent with it. A theme is combined WordPress:
> in multiple different places, with multiple interdependencies. This forms a web of shared data structures and code all contained within a shared memory space. If you followed the code execution for Thesis as it jumped between WordPress core code and Thesis-specific code, you'd get a headache, because you'd be jumping back and forth literally hundreds of times.

Even developers who didn't agree that a theme was necessarily derivative of WordPress thought that Thesis itself was derivative. Developer Drew Blas [wrote a script that took every line of WordPress and compared it with Thesis.](http://drewblas.com/2010/07/15/an-analysis-of-gpled-code-in-thesis/) His script pulled up a number of instances of Thesis code taken from WordPress. Core developer Andrew Nacin [pointed out](http://nacin.com/2010/07/15/thesis-gpl/) that Thesis' own inline documentation read "This function is mostly copy pasta from WP (wp-includes/media.php), but with minor alteration to play more nicely with our styling."

A former employee of DIY Themes [left a comment on Matt's blog](http://ma.tt/2010/07/syn-thesis-1/#comment-481845): 

> check out Thesis' handling of comments (thesis/lib/classes/comments.php). Large chunks of it are ripped right from WordPress. I know they are... because I'm the one who did the ripping. Whether I informed Chris of that or not doesn't matter because I no longer have any of our old chat logs to prove one way or another, but suffice it to say the latest public release of Thesis (and numerous versions before hand) contain obviously GPL code. Whether those portions get rewritten in the impending 3.0 release, I don't know... but for Chris to claim that he was responsible for and devised all of Thesis at 13:33 or so in the debate... Well, he was lying to you, either intentionally or not. (Actually, it'd have to be intentional; he should know that I contributed several important bits of code & features.)

On 22nd July, not even a week after the initial Mixergy interview, [Chris Pearson announced](https://twitter.com/pearsonified/status/19288707443) that Thesis was going to be released with a split license. The public furore compounded by pressure from inside DIY Themes forced Chris to capitulate. The license was drafted by [Brian Clark, who shortly after left DIY Themes,](http://technosailor.com/2010/07/29/exclusive-interview-brian-clark-leaves-diythemesthesis-theme/) citing "completely different opinions about the direction of the development of Thesis, the running of the company, and our relationship with the WordPress community." When Thesis 2 was launched in 2012 it had a new, proprietary, license.

The debate around Thesis and the GPL had far-reaching implications on everyone involved. [Prominent blogs moved away from Thesis](http://ma.tt/2010/08/syn-thesis-3-switchers/), with Brian Gardner's Genesis theme being a popular choice. Thesis and Chris Pearson became less prominent in the community, focusing instead on cultivating and building upon his large customer base. It was also made clear to the world that WordPress was prepared to go to court when developers flagrantly abused the license. There was, for a while, a relative calm in the community around the GPL. WordPress.org supported commercial theme sellers whose themes were 100% GPL and tolerated those that packaged their themes with two licenses. So when the next argument around the GPL flared up, this time it was about focused on the spirit of the GPL, as opposed to its legality. 

In the interview with Jeff Chandler in 2008, Matt is asked about the spirit of the GPL. The spirit of the GPL, he says, is about user empowerment, about the four freedoms: to use, distribute, modify, and distribute modifications of the software. Software  distributed with these four freedoms attached is done so in the spirit of the GPL. WordPress was created and distributed in this spirit, giving users full freedom with regards to the software. The opinion of the Software Freedom Law Centre with regards to WordPress themes, however, gave developers a loophole, one that let them be compliant with the GPL but without giving users the same freedoms as WordPress. The PHP in themes is required to be GPL, but the CSS, images, and Javascript are not. Thus, when Thesis was released with a GPL license it was with a split license - the PHP was GPL, the rest of the code and files were proprietary. This ensures that the theme is GPL compliant but it isn't released according to the driving ethos of the GPL - that of user freedom.

Theme sellers that sold their themes with a 100% GPL license were supported by WordPress. Those that weren't didn't get any support or promotion on WordPress.org or on official resources. For some of the major theme sellers, like Thesis, for example, this didn't have any major impact on their business. 

WordPress continues to collect data about sites. The data is used in a number of ways. It affects decision making. The project can make informed decisions about what technologies to support. The data was crucial in the decision to [drop support for PHP 4.0 and MySQL 4.0](http://wordpress.org/news/2010/07/eol-for-php4-and-mysql4/). Using the data collected, they were able to tell that, in 2010, around 11% of WordPress users were using a PHP version below 5.2, and that fewer than 6% of WordPress users were using MySQL 4.0. 	
As a way of enabling other people to contribute to the project full-time, completely outside of the commercial aspects of Automattic, Matt set up Audrey Capital. Audrey Capital is a small research and investment company through which Matt does his investments and employs people to work on the WorDPress project. It started life in XXXXX. It's first employee was Samuel Wood ([Otto](http://profiles.wordpress.org/otto)). 

Audrey Capital started through Otto and Matt's shared love of Barbecue. Otto was looking for a sponsor for a BBQ team at the international barbecue festival in Memphis. Knowing Matt likes barbecue, Otto called him up to ask him to sponsor the team. Matt said yes, and came to Memphis for the festival. The following year he sponsored again. This time, after the festival, he asked Otto if he wanted to come work for him. Otto said yes. 

To begin with, Otto was just paid directly by Matt to work on WordPress.org. The following year [check dates], he hired Andrew Nacin and officially set up Audrey Capital. Since then, three more people have been employed by Audrey to work on the WordPress project.

Matt had a number of intentions for Audrey Capital: the first was to have a company to help out new entrepreneurs. Secondly, he had lest time to code and wanted to hire some coders to do what he couldn't. And third, to provide a balance of people working on WordPress - some from Automattic, some from Audrey, and some from other companies. Since being launched, Audrey Capital has employed five people to work on the WordPress project.

While some Automattic employees were focused on building the core WordPress software, over the years others have had WordPress.org as a focus. Teams have built all sorts of features for WordPress.com users, including stats, publicise tools, image resizing, galleries, and a contact form. 

While many of these features were available as plugins on WordPress.org, it was Matt's vision to unify them, providing a single package that would bring all of WordPress.com's features to self-hosted WordPress users; this idea roamed the virtual hallways for a long time, simply as an idea known as "dot org connect".		

Automattic has a flat structure, with individuals working in small teams on different projects. Team Social took on the task of developing Jetpack. The process is described by Scott Berkun, in his book about working at Automattic, _The Year without Pants: WordPress.com and the Future of Work_.

[Jetpack launched in March 2011](http://jetpack.me/2011/03/09/blast-off/). As well as launching the product to the WordPress community, Automattic had created partnerships with hosting companies Bluehost, Dreamhost, Go Daddy, Media Temple, Host Gator, and Network Solutions. This meant that people who used the one-click installer on these hosts also got Jetpack installed. 		

While lots of users loved the functionality, it wasn't a big hit across the whole community. People questioned why they had to connect to WordPress.com to use functionality that they had previously been able to use standalone. While services such as stats required a connection to WordPress.com, functionality such as Twitter Widgets didn't. Other functionality, like After the Deadline, hadn't required a connection while it was a standalone plugin, but now it did. Jetpack had to be connected to WordPress.com to get access to any of the modules. Other concerns that people had were the intrusiveness of the plugin - it adds a big blue nag message to ask people to connect to WordPress.com, places itself at the top of the WordPress admin menu, and the module activation screen doesn't fit in with the overall user interface. People also took issue with the fact that some modules were activated by default - when the plugin is activated some modules are on and some aren't.		

This was a conscious decision made by the team.  "The idea behind that is, if you make it opt-in instead of opt-out, nobody uses any of it," says Toni Schneider. "They just turn on stats or whatever they want, and they never even look at the rest. So it's kind of wasted. Whereas most of it is actually quite useful."		

Other than the tools it publishes and code it shares on Github, Jetpack is the main connection that Automattic has with self-hosted WordPress users. 		

Automattic and WordPress.com provided a way for people who were passionate about WordPress to earn their living while working on it. Seven out of the ten first Automattic employees came from the WordPress community, and over the years the company has hired more and more talented contributors. While this has been positive for individuals and for Automattic, it hasn't always had a positive effect. In the early days, when WordPress.com was almost the sole focus, contributors would work on the core project which would then benefit Automattic. But some early contributors who became employees of Automattic found that they could spend less and less time on the project. Mark Riley, for example, was was employed to do support, found that he had no time to help out on the WordPress.org support forums. For other people, this has happened slowly, over time, as Automattic expanded out into other products, going in one direction, while the core project evolved into a different place, one with governance and structures, wildly different to the days of throwing up patches, heated discussions on wp-hackers, and waiting for Matt or Ryan to commit your code.		

As Automattic has grown, it has formed its own community. Automatticians often describe this as the Automattic family. They meet up all over the world, form close bonds, and intense working relationships. Contributors from the project who move to Automattic find that they become absorbed in the company culture and their contributions to the open source project diminish.		

To combat this, Automattic has one of its most abiding ways to support the project - the dot org team. This is a team of people within the company who are dedicated to working on the open source project. Ongoing members of the team are Ryan Boren and Andrew Ozz, WordPress lead developers, Jen Mylo, formerly UX lead of WordPress and responsible for the Crazyhorse redesign, and Andrea Middleton, who manages WordCamps. Teams are fairly fluid inside Automattic, and people come in to the dot org team to work on the WordPress project, often bringing with them the knowledge and skills that they've developed elsewhere in the company. Employees can also do a "dot org rotation", which means that they work on the WordPress project for a release cycle.		


In 2011, however, Automattic made some changes to the signup process that made members of the WordPress community angry. In the past, users could just select the free version and sign up for that. Automattic introduced a "pay what you want version" with a slider with which the user could select how much they wanted to pay. $24/year and over and the slider had a smiley face, but below that it turned to a progressively deeper frown, with the deepest frown reserved for $0.		

[Automattic reported](http://blog.akismet.com/2011/08/15/smile/) that people who paid for Akismet were prepared to pay more, with a big leap between $12 and $24 (the point at which the Akismet smiley started to smile). For some, this was the first time that they had noticed that Akismet was a commercial service. A ticket was opened up on WordPress trac, asking [that Akismet be removed from core](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/16838). In the discuss, Andrew Nacin, one of WordPress' lead developers said that while he would like to unbundle Akismet from core, there were practical considerations, the foremost of which was that users didn't want spam on their blog.		

Premium Themes:

As of 2014 many theme shops are thriving, with the biggest those that started right at the beginning of the premium theme craze, StudioPress, iThemes, and WooThemes, for example. The debates around themes are less to do with distribution and more focused on issues such as theme design and functionality. The latest move for theme shops, for example, is to reverse the trend that premium themes originally started - moving functionality from themes and into plugins, thereby making a WordPress user's data portable. The theme shops that adopted the GPL saw little impact on their business and some were able to use it to their advantage (like WooThemes, for example, who were able to [fork ecommerce plugin Jigoshop](http://wpcandy.com/reports/woothemes-forks-jigoshop-into-woocommerce/) and launch their own product, WooCommerce). 

Theme shops make up a large part of the economy around WordPress, and what they sell isn't simply a product but a community. StudioPress, for example, which produces Genesis has a large and loyal base of developers who build sites solely with their product. Theme sellers focus on providing support and services, creating a community, providing help and documentation. Their success demonstrates that one doesn't need to found an open source project to build a successful business on it, and that running a business in line with the ethos of the GPL is more than possible.
