Following the development of WordPress 3.3, at a core meetup at Tybee island, Jen proposed changes to the development process to try to ensure that the release ran on time and to prevent bottlenecks. This was [further discussed at a development chat in January 2012](http://make.wordpress.org/core/2012/01/05/dev-chat-notes-01042012/). One of the major suggestions was that feature development be done as teams, rather than be assigned to an individual. This was to help get around the problem of community members over-extending themselves. Sometimes it's a matter of taking on too many projects at once and not being able to complete them, other times life or a job gets in the way and a contributor abandons a WordPress core project. By having teams dedicated to a feature, there would be a small group of people accountable and responsible for delivering that feature on time.

The other decision made for 3.4 was to have a unifying theme for each release. 3.3 and before were usually random accumulations of features. The team agreed that the theme for 3.4 would be appearance and switching themes. It was following 3.4, however, that there was even bigger changes.	
3.5 was the first cycle to have dedicated release leads - Nacin and Koop. Following the changes after WordPress 3.3 to have a dedicated focus for a release, they decided to focus on media. Media was something that the development team wanted to tackle for some time but it was a huge task and no one had tackled it yet. As release leads, they decided to finally do it. While the release itself was well received, and media received the overhaul it needed, the actual development cycle wasn't such a success. It was a huge amount of work, lots of feedback, lots of changes to the codebase, and coding a whole new feature from scratch. There were four major iterations to the user interface, including one 72 hours before the release. Much of it was written in Javascript, where Koop's expertise lay. But as a PHP FOSS project, there weren't many others who could help him out. The two release leads spent between 80 - 100 hours a week working on the release	

It wasn't until much later that the plugin review team was set up. This was another gripe from theme developers, who felt that plugin developers should be subject to as rigorous review as theme developers. The question was asked both on [community blogs](http://wptavern.com/is-a-plugin-validation-team-a-pipe-dream) and on [wp-hackers](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2010-August/034146.html). The number of plugins in the repository was rapidly growing and some people had concerns about the quality of the code. For a long time, the only person processing plugins for the repository was Mark Riley.	

Eventually Otto started to review the plugins too, and later Mika Epstein, Pippin Williamson, and Boone Gorges were added to the team. It's more difficult to create an automated review process for plugins than it is for themes. A theme is a specific grouping of template files with a defined structure. It has functions it needs to call, it needs to have a header, footer, and a sidebar. But a plugin can be anything at all so there's no way to automate the review process. It is a lot of work. Yet the benefit of introducing this review process is that it has cleared out plugins with security holes, that were malicious or spam. A set of [guidelines has evolved](https://wordpress.org/plugins/about/guidelines/) that is intended to protect WordPress users. 	

One of the most significant changes to WordPress' communication channels has been make.WordPress.org. This is a network of blogs hosted on WordPress.org: each blog is a communication channel for the different teams on the project - core, documentation, polyglots, for example. Prior to having make.WordPress.org, much of the communication was scattered over different mailing lists and IRC chat rooms. 	

Each of the blogs on make.WordPress.org runs a P2 blog - this theme, created by Automattic for internal communication, is a microblogging tool that lets users post on the front end and then the post is followed by threaded comments where people can discuss the initial post. Unless made completely open, only people who are editors of a blog can make a post while anyone is able to comment.	

This created an important centralised space on WordPress.org where people can gather. If a contributor is interested in core development they can follow the core blog, forum moderators can follow the support blog, people with a UI focus can follow the UI blog. Contributors can subscribe to the blogs and follow along with what's going on from their email inboxes. While mailing lists are publicly archived, they often give the feeling of privacy because the contributor emails from their inbox and the mailing list archives are often difficult to find. By moving everything onto P2 blogs on make.WordPress.org the tone of the conversation was changed - everything took place in a very public place. While it didn't always work, this encouraged a more respectful attitude amongst community members, with a focus on getting work done rather than descending into arguments.	

A major player in the theme market, however, found itself in the eye of a GPL storm in 2013. Envato is the company behind a cluster of blogs and marketplaces that sell everything from WordPress themes and plugins, themes for other CMS, photographs, video, and illustrations. WordPress was just one aspect of their business, though a significant one, and ever growing. Envato had been one of the theme companies in 2009 who brought themselves into compliance with the GPL. Their themes were released with two licenses: GPL for the PHP, and a proprietary license of the rest of the files and code.

ThemeForest, Envato's theme marketplace, has long been a popular choice for individual theme sellers. It offers exposure and access to a huge community of users. With the theme shop marketplace becoming increasing saturated it became more and more difficult for new theme sellers to break through. Theme shops like StudioPress, WooThemes, and Elegant Themes came to dominate the market. ThemeForest offers everything a theme seller needs: hosting, sales tools, commerce, and a shop front. It provides a way for people to sell themes without having to do all of the associated setup work that can take up so much time. Besides, theme sellers were making good money out of selling on ThemeForest. As early as December 2011, Envato [announced its first theme seller to make a million dollars in theme sales](http://notes.envato.com/milestones/kriesi-first-to-1000000-on-the-marketplaces/).

The matter came to a head in January 2013 when ThemeForest author Jake Caputo received an email from Andrea Middleton from WordCamp Central. He was told that because he is an author on ThemeForest that he was not allowed to participate at official WordPress events. The events in question were WordCamps, the volunteer-organised events that are run all over the world. Jake had already spoken at two WordCamps, was planning to speak at a third, and was helping to organise WordCamp Chicago.

The issue was over theme licensing. WordCamps are official WordPress events that come with the seal of approval of the WordPress Foundation. [One of the stipulations](http://plan.wordcamp.org/become-an-organizer/representing-wordpress/) of being an organiser, volunteer, or speaker, is that you embrace the license. This goes beyond compliance and means that you pass on all of WordPress' freedoms to your users. In short, that all of your WordPress-related products are 100% GPL. The guidelines state that you must:

> Embrace the WordPress license. If distributing WordPress-derivative works (themes, plugins, WP distros), any person or business should give their users the same freedoms that WordPress itself provides. Note: this is one step above simple compliance, which requires PHP code to be GPL/compatible but allows proprietary licenses for JavaScript, CSS, and images. 100% GPL or compatible is required for promotion at WordCamps when WordPress-derivative works are involved, the same guidelines we follow on WordPress.org.

By selling a theme on ThemeForest, the only option available to authors was a split license, in which the CSS, Javascript, and images were distributed with a proprietary license. For Jake to become 100% GPL, he would have to stop selling on ThemeForest and find a new channel for selling his themes. This meant losing access to the more than 2 million members of ThemeForest.

The community was up in arms about Jake being banned from WordCamps. Many were angered by the actions of WordCamp Central; they thought it was unfair to ask theme sellers to give up their livelihood simply to speak at a WordCamps. Besides, couldn't theme author sellers simply not mention Envato or ThemeForest in their presentations? There were also those who supported WordPress.org, seeing the move as consistent with their ongoing stance on the GPL. If a developer wanted to sell on ThemeForest it was their choice, just as it was WordPress.org's choice to only support 100% GPL products.

On both sides, people were angered for ThemeForest's authors. Whereas the issue had little impact on the powers-that-be at WordPress or Envato, the theme authors stuck in the middle were the ones to suffer. They had no choice about their license and moving off ThemeForest would lose them their livelihood, in the short term at least.

The argument raged in the comments thread of Jake's blog, spiralling to other [WordPress community blogs](http://www.poststat.us/what-now-for-commercial-theme-authors/), and to the [ThemeForest forums](http://themeforest.net/forums/thread/wordpressorg-bans-themeforest-members-from-participating-in-official-wordcamp-gatherings/85648?page=2). Matt joined in the discussion on Jake's blog, [saying that](http://www.designcrumbs.com/automatically-blackballed#comment-430) if ThemeForest authors had a choice about licensing and could release their theme under the GPL, then "Envato would still be breaking the guideline, but Jake wouldn't, so it'd be fine for Jake to be involved with WordCamps."

Collis Ta'eed, CEO of Envato, [responded on WordPress news blog WP Daily](http://torquemag.io/themeforest-wordcamps/)[1]. In the post, he outlines the reasons for Envato's licensing model. As a designer himself, Collis' main concern is protecting his designer's rights while ensuring that customers are able to adequately make use of the resources they purchase.

As had happened before in past WordPress arguments, the disagreement came down to a difference of emphasis. While WordPress emphasised the freedom of users, Envato emphasised the rights of creators. Both felt strongly that they had the moral imperative, and for either to back down would be to violate principles that underpinned their organisation.

Collis was worried about having a GPL option for authors. He wrote "I worry that external pressures will force an increasing number of our authors to change their license choice, some happily, some not." Having just one (split) license meant that authors wouldn't be forced into that situation. Collis' professional background influenced his decision about licensing. He was a designer, and he felt that he had to protect other designers. The license he went went was one that made sense to him as a designer: 

Theme authors had a choice whether to sell their themes on ThemeForest, or sell their themes in a way that was in line with the WordPress community's ethos (and thus speak at WordCamps). But [in a podcast on WP Candy](http://wpcandy.com/podcasts/035-with-special-guest-jake-caputo/), Jake made it clear that he felt that he didn't have a choice about where to sell his themes. ThemeForest had become such an important part of his income that he would have to forfeit that income if he moved elsewhere. After the podcast, [Collis wrote a second post on WP Daily](http://torquemag.io/theme-clarity/), in which he said:

> I think I've been wrong in my stance. I would like to change that stance, and feel that ThemeForest should offer an option for authors, if they choose, to sell their themes with a GPL license covering the entirety of the theme. I am going to take this option to our community.

He announced in the post that he would open a survey for ThemeForest authors to see if they wanted a GPL opt-in option. "I felt pretty guilty that our authors were paying some sort of price for selling with us, that felt pretty wrong," says Collis now. [The results](http://notes.envato.com/news/survey-results-about-gpl-opt-in-choice/) demonstrated that an equal amount of verified authors would license their themes under the GPL as those who wouldn't, though 35% of sellers said that they didn't know what they would do. It also showed, however, that theme authors who wished to distribute their themes under the GPL were mostly unconcerned about piracy, while the majority of those who wished to stick to a split license or who didn't know were much more concerned about piracy. They were also much more concerned about the resale and retribution of their products. On 26th March, Collis announced that theme authors [could now sell their themes on ThemeForest with a 100% GPL license](http://notes.envato.com/general/100-gpl-option-now-available-plus-woothemes-arrives/). Jake was [once again allowed to speak at WordCamps](http://www.designcrumbs.com/un-blackballed). 
In January 2013, [new icons were proposed by Ben Dunkle](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/23333) and [checked in by Andrew Ozz](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/23369). The changes kicked off huge discussions about icons, [span off another trac ticket](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/23415), and a [long discussion on the UI P2](http://make.wordpress.org/ui/2013/02/12/discuss-icons/.	

Consensus couldn't be reached on the icons so Mark, who was release lead at the time, made the decision to not put the changes in WordPress 3.6. It was decided that instead designers who were interested in redesigning the admin would play around with the design in a plugin. The plugin was called [MP6](http://wordpress.org/plugins/mp6/). 	

It was four years before there was another redesign of the admin. This time it was helmed by the designer who had put the coat of paint on Crazyhorse - Matt Miklic. The project project started with a change of icons. New icons, designed by Ben Dunkle, were introduced into core in one flat colour. The WordPress admin was starting to look outdated, particularly on retina displays on which the icons looked pixelated. Flat icons would scale properly and also enable designers to colour the icons using CSS. The [reaction to the icons in the community was mixed](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/23333) though mostly negative - people didn't think that they fit with the current design. Having up-to-date icons only served to show how dated the rest of the admin had become.

As a result of the discussions on trac and on the UI blog, Matt opened up a Skype channel which he asked Matt Thomas and Ben Dunkle to join. He asked them to think about how a redesign might work, gave them some parameters, and told them to reimagine the WordPress admin. MT, who'd been involved with Crazyhorse, instinctively felt that the work done as part of that project ought to be respected, and instead focused on carrying out an aesthetic refresh as opposed to a functional one.

The MP6 project learned from each major design effort in WordPress, taking the best aspects and trying to avoid the worst. Both Matt and MT were keenly aware of the issues and challenges that had arisen in each design phase. Shuttle, for example, had fallen into the pitfall of being cut off from the rest of the community - a cloistered group of designers who were throwing around comps while slowly losing touch with "the client". There was a lack of accountability which was compounded by the fact that no one person was responsible for overall vision.

These problems were the result of the group's attempt to solve an initial problem - designing in an open source environment can lead to a poor signal-to-noise ratio. However, by trying to solve one problem, they created another. The MP6 project took a different approach. A Skype channel was created for the group so that they could talk in private, but anyone was allowed to join in. "Even though the group worked in private," says MT, "the door into the group we were working on was open, so if anyone said they were interested they could just walk in."

The work was carried out in a plugin hosted in the WordPress plugin directory. Anyone could install the plugin and see the changes in their admin. Every week a release had to be built and released publicly for feedback. Besides this, the group posted a weekly report where anyone could provide feedback. This meant that there were multiple ways for community members to be involved on different levels. It also meant that the group could never steer too far off course. The core team were always aware of what was going on with MP6 and could provide feedback.

There were even more designers involved than there were with Shuttle, with the group eventually growing to around 15 members. But they avoided the problem of "too many cooks" by having MT lead the team. It was accepted within the group that MT had the final say on the design. 

What Happy Cog managed to do was to look at WordPress with a fresh set of eyes. Their distance from the product meant that they were able to treat it as a piece of software, not as something that they were devoted to. They stayed in touch with their client, Matt, but not with the diverse the community of WordPress users and all of their thoughts and opinions. MP6 solicited feedback from all of the people with a stake in the project. That did bring its own challenges - whose feedback was the most legitimate? What ought to be listened to? When was someone just complaining for the sake of it?

The Crazyhorse project emphasised the importance of in-depth user testing. It's not enough for a designer to make something look pretty - the interface has to be something that users can interact with. If the interface is changed into something people can't use or that they hate, users will abandon the software or they won't update. With all of the testing that had gone into Crazyhorse, MT knew that he didn't want to carry out a structural overhaul which would have required extensive testing and data gathering to make sure a change was actually an improvement as opposed to just a change for the sake of it. 

The MP6 project was [announced in March 2013](http://make.wordpress.org/ui/2013/03/09/as-a-continuation-of-the-work-begun-in/), starting out small but grew over the course of the year. The design process began with MT playing around with the CSS. He started out with a unified black L-shaped bar around the top and the side: "that was the idea," he says now, "that the black would feel like a background and the white would feel like the sheet of paper lying on top of it, so it would unify these disparate things." Once the basic visual was put together by MT, the rest of the contributors started refining the design.

Not everything went smoothly. An issue that caused particular controversy was the [inclusion of web fonts from Google Fonts](http://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/11/11/open-sans-bundling-vs-linking/). This meant that Open Sans, the font used in WordPress' admin screens, was hosted on Google's servers. Whenever a user logs into their admin the fonts are served from Google. This causes problems for people who don't want to open a connection to Google from their website, and for people in whose countries Google is blocked. Bundling them with WordPress, however, would require a huge amount of specialised work to ensure that they worked across platforms, browsers, and in different languages. In the end, the decision was made to link to Google and a plugin was created to allow people to switch web fonts off. 

Despite minor hitches, the MP6 project went smoothly. Joen Asmussen, who'd been a part of the Shuttle project 8 years earlier says "I would say that MP6 does everything right that Shuttle did wrong." It was included in version 3.8 of WordPress, released in December 2013, demonstrating that, while it may take a while to get there, harmonious open source design is possible.

In a post in 2013, [Andrew Nacin wrote that](http://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/07/28/potential-roadmap-for-taxonomy-meta-and-post-relationships/) "Hindsight is 20/20, and shared terms are the bane of taxonomies in WordPress." In the shared term structure, terms are represented by two different IDs: a term ID (which refers to the name and slug) and a term taxonomy ID. A term ID can appear in multiple taxonomies so to properly identify a particular term you must have either the term taxonomy ID or the term ID along with the taxonomy. 	

This is a problem for building features such as term meta. In order to attach metadata to a term, there needs to be only one object identifier - the term taxonomy ID, but the public ID used in the API is the term ID (along with the taxonomy). WordPress has a long-term commitment to maintaining backwards compatibility so just simply creating a new schema isn't possible. In order to get rid of shared terms, which cause so many problems, the developers need to do it step by step, over a number of major releases, in which shared terms stop being created, they are split apart, slugs and names are moved from wp_terms to wp_term_taxonomy, and the wp_terms table is dropped.	

Not just core developers have [problems with shared terms](http://www.oomphinc.com/blog/2012-01/ruminations-on-the-wordpress-taxonomy-system/). A good example is use of the word orange. A developer might create the taxonomy "Colours" and the taxonomy "Fruit" and user might place the term "orange" in both. Conceptually, this is a different - a colour and a fruit - and they appear in the user interface as different concepts, but the database treats them as the same thing. So if I made changes to the capitalisation of one, for example, it would also change the capitalisation of the other.	

3.6 was another release that precipitated major changes to the development process. This had been the culmination of years of minor development issues, but 3.6 tipped it over the edge. WordPress 3.6 was the release that was supposed to see the introduction of a user interface for Post Formats. [Post Formats](http://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Formats) was a theme feature introduced in WordPress 3.1. It allowed theme developers to format posts in different ways. Much in the same way that Tumblr allowed users to post types of posts, like quotes or images, theme developers could style types of posts in different ways.	

There wasn't, however, a standard user interface for Post Formats. In WordPress 3.6, release leads Mark Jaquith and Aaron Campbell decided to tackle the problem. At that time, the release cycle fell into a number of different stages. In the scoping chat, the release lead would decide on the features for the release, create teams, and assign feature leads. Then the feature leads would run their teams focused on each feature, with the release lead coordinating and making the final decision on what was going to go in.	

Carrying out major changes to the user interface in the space of just a few months is challenging at best. The 3.5 release had demonstrated that in order to get the release done at least within a reasonable space of time from the touted date, the release leads would have to put in a heroic effort of coding to get it done.	
	
The 3.6 release cycle ran into problems. [Features were dropped](http://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/02/19/dropping-editorial-flow/) as contributors found they had overstretched themselves and dropped out. The biggest issue, however, was around the Post Formats UI.	

The problem with Post Formats was that despite all of the time that was spent on wireframes and development, the team ended up just not liking them. They had come up with the specifications, built to those specifications, and then ended up being unhappy with the final result. "It's like ordering something from the restaurant that sounds great," says Aaron Campbell, "but as soon as it sits in front of you and you smell it, it's like, "Ahh, definitely not what I was in the mood for."	

The target date for releasing WordPress 3.6 was April 29th. On April 23rd, Jen, who had by that point stepped back from her involvement in the development cycle, [posted on the core development blog](http://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/04/23/post-formats-schedules-and-philosophy/), pointing out that Post Formats were not ready, that the user interface was confusing, and pointing to the WordPress philosophy that deadlines are not arbitrary.	

The thread, in addition to highlighting the flaws in the post formats UI, showed that not everyone in the development team was behind the "deadlines are not arbitrary" claus in WordPress' philosophy. [Ryan Boren wrote](http://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/04/23/post-formats-schedules-and-philosophy/#comment-8523):	
> The four month deadline is so fanciful as to be arbitrary. It always has been. Historically, we just can't do a major release with a marquee UI feature in that time, certainly not without heroic efforts of the 3.5 sort. So we end up facing decisions like this. Every single release we wonder if we have to punt the marquee feature. Punting often requires major surgery that can be as much work as finishing the feature. Punting is demoralizing. Four month releases are empty promises that bring us here.	

In the end, [Mark and Aaron decided to pull the feature](http://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/05/29/post-formats-ui-is-exiting-core-will-live-as-a-plugin/). A lot of work had to go in to [removing it from core](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24452). The release was heavily delayed, appearing on 1st August, 2013, three months after the intended release date. 	

Again, a WordPress release had been held up by a user facing feature. Features had always been tied to the development cycle, which mean that the amount of time put in to features with heavy UI was restricted by the amount of time designated for a release cycle. Just like tagging before it, the Post Formats UI had proved too complex to do within the space of a few months. It isn't always as easy to make interface decisions, it's harder to iterate on design than on code.	

The solution to this problem was available in WordPress' infrastructure. Twice before, core user features had been pulled from plugins into core - Widgets and Menus. Widgets had been built for the WordPress.com audience, turned into a plugin, and brought in to core. Menus had been a problem that had stumped the core development team and they found the solution to their problem elsewhere. In both these cases, design and testing for the feature had taken place long before it got anywhere near core.	

And even as the debate over the Post Formats UI was continuing, another WordPress feature was being developed as a plugin.

The admin redesign was led in plugin form by Matt Miklic (MT). As development continued on the core product, development of the feature happened separately. It wasn't constrained by the release timeline of WordPress. It also allowed the team working on it to iterate quickly on it, and users could test it out and provide feedback simply by installing a plugin. This hadn't been possible before. In order to test out new features in the past, a person would have to be running a version of trunk. By developing the feature as a plugin, a community member could just focus on helping with the sole plugin that they were interested in.	
MP6 was proving to be a success, and in the summer of 2013, it was decided to develop two versions of WordPress simultaneously - 3.7 and 3.8. 3.7 was a platform-focused release led by Andrew Nacin and John Cave. This release was a two month cycle focused on stability and security, while for 3.8 potential new features would be developed as a plugin.	
In a [post on the development blog, Andrew Nacin wrote]:	
> This "features as plugins" method* will allow teams to conceptualize, design, and fully develop features before landing them in core. This removes a lot of the risk of a particular feature introducing uncertainty into a release (see also 3.6, 3.5, 3.4 ...) and provides ample room for experimentation, testing, and failure. As we've seen with MP6, the autonomy given to a feature team can also allow for more rapid development. And in a way, 3.7 provides a bit of a buffer while we get this new process off the ground.	

With features now decoupled from release cycles, it gave developers more scope for experimentation, and ensured that development of the core produced wouldn't be held up by failures within one specific feature. The MP6 admin redesign was [one of the first plugins proposed under this model](http://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/10/23/mp6-3-8-proposal/). It was successfully implemented, as was the widget customiser, the admin redesign, the new theme experience, and changes to the widget functionality. 

More recently, it's used as part of the automatic updating system that appeared in WordPress 3.7, when WordPress started to update blogs automatically for point releases. With the data available, WordPress can personalise automatic updates to ensure that the site is upgraded correctly. WordPress' terms of service dictates what can and cannot be done with data - it's never publicly dealt with or sold.	
In January 2014, just after leading the 3.8 release cycle, [Matt took over as CEO of Automattic](http://ma.tt/2014/01/toni-automattic-ceo/). A few months later, in May, he [announced that Automattic had raised $160 million in funding](http://ma.tt/2014/05/new-funding-for-automattic/), with the [company being valued at $1.16 billion](http://time.com/88025/wordpress-parent-automattic-joins-the-billion-dollar-club/). In his post on the funding, Matt writes about how the additional funding will allow them to hire more staff, work on new products, and scale up the company. He makes a nod to the hundreds of developers and the large commercial companies who make up the WordPress ecosystem.
