## Feedback

The following feedback is particularly valuable:
- *Factual errors*: notes about factual errors are welcome. All suggestions for changes should be evidenced with links that back up any claims. Any facts that cannot be corroborated will not be included.
- *Clarity*:  any paragraphs or sections that you feel are not clear. This would be of particular help in sections that are technical in nature.
- *Omissions*: anything that you feel has been omitted or not sufficiently covered. Note that this is a lengthy piece of writing and many issues have to be condensed to ensure that it is a manageable and interesting read. Suggestions about omissions should be accompanied with information about why it should be included, and backed up with evidence as to their importance.
- *Images*: if you have any images that you feel would complement the text, we'd love to have them.

All feedback should be opened as [issues](https://github.com/WordPress/book/issues) in the tracker.

Note: the [interviews conducted as part of this project](http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews) are available should you wish to reference anything or conduct your own research.
